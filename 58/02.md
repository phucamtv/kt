<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Warning to Pay Attention </h3></div>
<span class="verse he_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>We must pay the most careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away. </span>
<span class="verse he_2_2"><sup>2</sup>For since the message spoken through angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment, </span>
<span class="verse he_2_3"><sup>3</sup>how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him. </span>
<span class="verse he_2_4"><sup>4</sup>God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Made Fully Human </h3></div>
<span class="verse he_2_5"> <sup>5</sup>It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking. </span>
<span class="verse he_2_6"><sup>6</sup>But there is a place where someone has testified: <br/>  “What is mankind that you are mindful of them, <br/>   a son of man that you care for him? <br/></span>
<span class="verse he_2_7">  <sup>7</sup>You made them a little<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or them for a little while">⚓</a> lower than the angels; <br/>   you crowned them with glory and honor <br/></span>
<span class="verse he_2_8">   <sup>8</sup>and put everything under their feet.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 8:4-6">⚓</a><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or 7You made him a little lower than the angels;/ you crowned him with glory and honor/ 8and put everything under his feet.”">⚓</a><br/>In putting everything under them,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or him">⚓</a> God left nothing that is not subject to them.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or him">⚓</a> Yet at present we do not see everything subject to them.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or him">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse he_2_9"><sup>9</sup>But we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone. <br/></span>
<span class="verse he_2_10"> <sup>10</sup>In bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through what he suffered. </span>
<span class="verse he_2_11"><sup>11</sup>Both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek word for brothers and sisters (adelphoi ) refers here to believers, both men and women, as part of God’s family; also in verse 12; and in 3:1, 12; 10:19; 13:22.">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse he_2_12"><sup>12</sup>He says, <br/>  “I will declare your name to my brothers and sisters; <br/>   in the assembly I will sing your praises.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 22:22">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse he_2_13"><sup>13</sup>And again, <br/>  “I will put my trust in him.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 8:17">⚓</a><br/>And again he says, <br/>  “Here am I, and the children God has given me.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 8:18">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse he_2_14"> <sup>14</sup>Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil— </span>
<span class="verse he_2_15"><sup>15</sup>and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death. </span>
<span class="verse he_2_16"><sup>16</sup>For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham’s descendants. </span>
<span class="verse he_2_17"><sup>17</sup>For this reason he had to be made like them,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or like his brothers">⚓</a> fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people. </span>
<span class="verse he_2_18"><sup>18</sup>Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted. <br/></span>
