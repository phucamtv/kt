<div class="title"><h1>1</h1><h3>God’s Final Word: His Son </h3></div>
<span class="verse he_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, </span>
<span class="verse he_1_2"><sup>2</sup>but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe. </span>
<span class="verse he_1_3"><sup>3</sup>The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven. </span>
<span class="verse he_1_4"><sup>4</sup>So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Son Superior to Angels </h3></div>
<span class="verse he_1_5"> <sup>5</sup>For to which of the angels did God ever say, <br/>  “You are my Son; <br/>   today I have become your Father”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 2:7">⚓</a> ? <br/>Or again, <br/>  “I will be his Father, <br/>   and he will be my Son”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Samuel 7:14; 1 Chron. 17:13">⚓</a> ? <br/></span>
<span class="verse he_1_6"><sup>6</sup>And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, <br/>  “Let all God’s angels worship him.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:43 (see Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint)">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse he_1_7"><sup>7</sup>In speaking of the angels he says, <br/>  “He makes his angels spirits, <br/>   and his servants flames of fire.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 104:4">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse he_1_8"><sup>8</sup>But about the Son he says, <br/>  “Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever; <br/>   a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom. <br/></span>
<span class="verse he_1_9">  <sup>9</sup>You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; <br/>   therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions <br/>   by anointing you with the oil of joy.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 45:6,7">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse he_1_10"><sup>10</sup>He also says, <br/>  “In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, <br/>   and the heavens are the work of your hands. <br/></span>
<span class="verse he_1_11">  <sup>11</sup>They will perish, but you remain; <br/>   they will all wear out like a garment. <br/></span>
<span class="verse he_1_12">  <sup>12</sup>You will roll them up like a robe; <br/>   like a garment they will be changed. <br/>  But you remain the same, <br/>   and your years will never end.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 102:25-27">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse he_1_13"><sup>13</sup>To which of the angels did God ever say, <br/>  “Sit at my right hand <br/>   until I make your enemies <br/>   a footstool for your feet”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 110:1">⚓</a> ? <br/></span>
<span class="verse he_1_14"><sup>14</sup>Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation? <br/></span>
