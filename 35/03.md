<span class="verse ha_3_2">  <sup>2</sup>Lord, I have heard of your fame; <br/>   I stand in awe of your deeds, Lord. <br/>  Repeat them in our day, <br/>   in our time make them known; <br/>   in wrath remember mercy. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_3">  <sup>3</sup>God came from Teman, <br/>   the Holy One from Mount Paran.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here and at the middle of verse 9 and at the end of verse 13.">⚓</a><br/>  His glory covered the heavens <br/>   and his praise filled the earth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_4">  <sup>4</sup>His splendor was like the sunrise; <br/>   rays flashed from his hand, <br/>   where his power was hidden. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_5">  <sup>5</sup>Plague went before him; <br/>   pestilence followed his steps. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_6">  <sup>6</sup>He stood, and shook the earth; <br/>   he looked, and made the nations tremble. <br/>  The ancient mountains crumbled <br/>   and the age-old hills collapsed— <br/>   but he marches on forever. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_7">  <sup>7</sup>I saw the tents of Cushan in distress, <br/>   the dwellings of Midian in anguish. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_8">  <sup>8</sup>Were you angry with the rivers, Lord? <br/>   Was your wrath against the streams? <br/>  Did you rage against the sea <br/>   when you rode your horses <br/>   and your chariots to victory? <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_9">  <sup>9</sup>You uncovered your bow, <br/>   you called for many arrows. <br/>  You split the earth with rivers; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_10">   <sup>10</sup>the mountains saw you and writhed. <br/>  Torrents of water swept by; <br/>   the deep roared <br/>   and lifted its waves on high. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_11">  <sup>11</sup>Sun and moon stood still in the heavens <br/>   at the glint of your flying arrows, <br/>   at the lightning of your flashing spear. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_12">  <sup>12</sup>In wrath you strode through the earth <br/>   and in anger you threshed the nations. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_13">  <sup>13</sup>You came out to deliver your people, <br/>   to save your anointed one. <br/>  You crushed the leader of the land of wickedness, <br/>   you stripped him from head to foot. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_14">  <sup>14</sup>With his own spear you pierced his head <br/>   when his warriors stormed out to scatter us, <br/>  gloating as though about to devour <br/>   the wretched who were in hiding. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_15">  <sup>15</sup>You trampled the sea with your horses, <br/>   churning the great waters. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_16">  <sup>16</sup>I heard and my heart pounded, <br/>   my lips quivered at the sound; <br/>  decay crept into my bones, <br/>   and my legs trembled. <br/>  Yet I will wait patiently for the day of calamity <br/>   to come on the nation invading us. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_17">  <sup>17</sup>Though the fig tree does not bud <br/>   and there are no grapes on the vines, <br/>  though the olive crop fails <br/>   and the fields produce no food, <br/>  though there are no sheep in the pen <br/>   and no cattle in the stalls, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_18">  <sup>18</sup>yet I will rejoice in the Lord, <br/>   I will be joyful in God my Savior. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_19">  <sup>19</sup>The Sovereign Lord is my strength; <br/>   he makes my feet like the feet of a deer, <br/>   he enables me to tread on the heights. <br/></span>
