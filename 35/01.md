<span class="verse ha_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>The prophecy that Habakkuk the prophet received. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Habakkuk’s Complaint </h3></div>
<span class="verse ha_1_2">  <sup>2</sup>How long, Lord, must I call for help, <br/>   but you do not listen? <br/>  Or cry out to you, “Violence!” <br/>   but you do not save? <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_1_3">  <sup>3</sup>Why do you make me look at injustice? <br/>   Why do you tolerate wrongdoing? <br/>  Destruction and violence are before me; <br/>   there is strife, and conflict abounds. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_1_4">  <sup>4</sup>Therefore the law is paralyzed, <br/>   and justice never prevails. <br/>  The wicked hem in the righteous, <br/>   so that justice is perverted. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Lord’s Answer </h3></div>
<span class="verse ha_1_5">  <sup>5</sup>“Look at the nations and watch— <br/>   and be utterly amazed. <br/>  For I am going to do something in your days <br/>   that you would not believe, <br/>   even if you were told. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_1_6">  <sup>6</sup>I am raising up the Babylonians,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Chaldeans">⚓</a><br/>   that ruthless and impetuous people, <br/>  who sweep across the whole earth <br/>   to seize dwellings not their own. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_1_7">  <sup>7</sup>They are a feared and dreaded people; <br/>   they are a law to themselves <br/>   and promote their own honor. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_1_8">  <sup>8</sup>Their horses are swifter than leopards, <br/>   fiercer than wolves at dusk. <br/>  Their cavalry gallops headlong; <br/>   their horsemen come from afar. <br/>  They fly like an eagle swooping to devour; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_1_9">   <sup>9</sup>they all come intent on violence. <br/>  Their hordes<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.">⚓</a> advance like a desert wind <br/>   and gather prisoners like sand. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_1_10">  <sup>10</sup>They mock kings <br/>   and scoff at rulers. <br/>  They laugh at all fortified cities; <br/>   by building earthen ramps they capture them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_1_11">  <sup>11</sup>Then they sweep past like the wind and go on— <br/>   guilty people, whose own strength is their god.” <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Habakkuk’s Second Complaint </h3></div>
<span class="verse ha_1_12">  <sup>12</sup>Lord, are you not from everlasting? <br/>   My God, my Holy One, you<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="An ancient Hebrew scribal tradition; Masoretic Text we">⚓</a> will never die. <br/>  You, Lord, have appointed them to execute judgment; <br/>   you, my Rock, have ordained them to punish. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_1_13">  <sup>13</sup>Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; <br/>   you cannot tolerate wrongdoing. <br/>  Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? <br/>   Why are you silent while the wicked <br/>   swallow up those more righteous than themselves? <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_1_14">  <sup>14</sup>You have made people like the fish in the sea, <br/>   like the sea creatures that have no ruler. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_1_15">  <sup>15</sup>The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks, <br/>   he catches them in his net, <br/>  he gathers them up in his dragnet; <br/>   and so he rejoices and is glad. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_1_16">  <sup>16</sup>Therefore he sacrifices to his net <br/>   and burns incense to his dragnet, <br/>  for by his net he lives in luxury <br/>   and enjoys the choicest food. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_1_17">  <sup>17</sup>Is he to keep on emptying his net, <br/>   destroying nations without mercy? <br/><br/></span>
