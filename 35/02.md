<span class="verse ha_2_1">  <sup>1</sup>I will stand at my watch <br/>   and station myself on the ramparts; <br/>  I will look to see what he will say to me, <br/>   and what answer I am to give to this complaint.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or and what to answer when I am rebuked">⚓</a><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Lord’s Answer </h3></div>
<span class="verse ha_2_2"> <sup>2</sup>Then the Lord replied: <br/>  “Write down the revelation <br/>   and make it plain on tablets <br/>   so that a herald<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or so that whoever reads it">⚓</a> may run with it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_2_3">  <sup>3</sup>For the revelation awaits an appointed time; <br/>   it speaks of the end <br/>   and will not prove false. <br/>  Though it linger, wait for it; <br/>   it<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Though he linger, wait for him; / he">⚓</a> will certainly come <br/>   and will not delay. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_2_4">  <sup>4</sup>“See, the enemy is puffed up; <br/>   his desires are not upright— <br/>   but the righteous person will live by his faithfulness<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or faith">⚓</a> — <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_2_5">  <sup>5</sup>indeed, wine betrays him; <br/>   he is arrogant and never at rest. <br/>  Because he is as greedy as the grave <br/>   and like death is never satisfied, <br/>  he gathers to himself all the nations <br/>   and takes captive all the peoples. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_2_6"> <sup>6</sup>“Will not all of them taunt him with ridicule and scorn, saying, <br/>  “ ‘Woe to him who piles up stolen goods <br/>   and makes himself wealthy by extortion! <br/>   How long must this go on?’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_2_7">  <sup>7</sup>Will not your creditors suddenly arise? <br/>   Will they not wake up and make you tremble? <br/>   Then you will become their prey. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_2_8">  <sup>8</sup>Because you have plundered many nations, <br/>   the peoples who are left will plunder you. <br/>  For you have shed human blood; <br/>   you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_2_9">  <sup>9</sup>“Woe to him who builds his house by unjust gain, <br/>   setting his nest on high <br/>   to escape the clutches of ruin! <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_2_10">  <sup>10</sup>You have plotted the ruin of many peoples, <br/>   shaming your own house and forfeiting your life. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_2_11">  <sup>11</sup>The stones of the wall will cry out, <br/>   and the beams of the woodwork will echo it. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_2_12">  <sup>12</sup>“Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed <br/>   and establishes a town by injustice! <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_2_13">  <sup>13</sup>Has not the Lord Almighty determined <br/>   that the people’s labor is only fuel for the fire, <br/>   that the nations exhaust themselves for nothing? <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_2_14">  <sup>14</sup>For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord<br/>   as the waters cover the sea. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_2_15">  <sup>15</sup>“Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbors, <br/>   pouring it from the wineskin till they are drunk, <br/>   so that he can gaze on their naked bodies! <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_2_16">  <sup>16</sup>You will be filled with shame instead of glory. <br/>   Now it is your turn! Drink and let your nakedness be exposed<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Masoretic Text; Dead Sea Scrolls, Aquila, Vulgate and Syriac (see also Septuagint) and stagger">⚓</a> ! <br/>  The cup from the Lord’s right hand is coming around to you, <br/>   and disgrace will cover your glory. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_2_17">  <sup>17</sup>The violence you have done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, <br/>   and your destruction of animals will terrify you. <br/>  For you have shed human blood; <br/>   you have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_2_18">  <sup>18</sup>“Of what value is an idol carved by a craftsman? <br/>   Or an image that teaches lies? <br/>  For the one who makes it trusts in his own creation; <br/>   he makes idols that cannot speak. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_2_19">  <sup>19</sup>Woe to him who says to wood, ‘Come to life!’ <br/>   Or to lifeless stone, ‘Wake up!’ <br/>  Can it give guidance? <br/>   It is covered with gold and silver; <br/>   there is no breath in it.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_2_20">  <sup>20</sup>The Lord is in his holy temple; <br/>   let all the earth be silent before him. <br/></span>
