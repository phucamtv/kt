<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Jonah’s Prayer </h3></div>
<span class="verse gion_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the Lord his God. </span>
<span class="verse gion_2_2"><sup>2</sup>He said: <br/>  “In my distress I called to the Lord, <br/>   and he answered me. <br/>  From deep in the realm of the dead I called for help, <br/>   and you listened to my cry. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_2_3">  <sup>3</sup>You hurled me into the depths, <br/>   into the very heart of the seas, <br/>   and the currents swirled about me; <br/>  all your waves and breakers <br/>   swept over me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_2_4">  <sup>4</sup>I said, ‘I have been banished <br/>   from your sight; <br/>  yet I will look again <br/>   toward your holy temple.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_2_5">  <sup>5</sup>The engulfing waters threatened me,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or waters were at my throat">⚓</a><br/>   the deep surrounded me; <br/>   seaweed was wrapped around my head. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_2_6">  <sup>6</sup>To the roots of the mountains I sank down; <br/>   the earth beneath barred me in forever. <br/>  But you, Lord my God, <br/>   brought my life up from the pit. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_2_7">  <sup>7</sup>“When my life was ebbing away, <br/>   I remembered you, Lord, <br/>  and my prayer rose to you, <br/>   to your holy temple. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_2_8">  <sup>8</sup>“Those who cling to worthless idols <br/>   turn away from God’s love for them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_2_9">  <sup>9</sup>But I, with shouts of grateful praise, <br/>   will sacrifice to you. <br/>  What I have vowed I will make good. <br/>   I will say, ‘Salvation comes from the Lord.’ ” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_2_10"> <sup>10</sup>And the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land. <br/></span>
