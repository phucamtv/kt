<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>Jonah Goes to Nineveh </h3></div>
<span class="verse gion_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time: </span>
<span class="verse gion_3_2"><sup>2</sup>“Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_3_3"> <sup>3</sup>Jonah obeyed the word of the Lord and went to Nineveh. Now Nineveh was a very large city; it took three days to go through it. </span>
<span class="verse gion_3_4"><sup>4</sup>Jonah began by going a day’s journey into the city, proclaiming, “Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown.” </span>
<span class="verse gion_3_5"><sup>5</sup>The Ninevites believed God. A fast was proclaimed, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_3_6"> <sup>6</sup>When Jonah’s warning reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust. </span>
<span class="verse gion_3_7"><sup>7</sup>This is the proclamation he issued in Nineveh: <br/> “By the decree of the king and his nobles: <br/> Do not let people or animals, herds or flocks, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink. </span>
<span class="verse gion_3_8"><sup>8</sup>But let people and animals be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence. </span>
<span class="verse gion_3_9"><sup>9</sup>Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_3_10"> <sup>10</sup>When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he relented and did not bring on them the destruction he had threatened. <br/></span>
