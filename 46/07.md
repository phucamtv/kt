<div class="title"><h1>7</h1><h3>Concerning Married Life </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_7_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now for the matters you wrote about: “It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.” </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_2"><sup>2</sup>But since sexual immorality is occurring, each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each woman with her own husband. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_3"><sup>3</sup>The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_4"><sup>4</sup>The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_5"><sup>5</sup>Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_6"><sup>6</sup>I say this as a concession, not as a command. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_7"><sup>7</sup>I wish that all of you were as I am. But each of you has your own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_8"> <sup>8</sup>Now to the unmarried<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or widowers">⚓</a> and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I do. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_9"><sup>9</sup>But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_10"> <sup>10</sup>To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_11"><sup>11</sup>But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_12"> <sup>12</sup>To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_13"><sup>13</sup>And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_14"><sup>14</sup>For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_15"> <sup>15</sup>But if the unbeliever leaves, let it be so. The brother or the sister is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_16"><sup>16</sup>How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Concerning Change of Status </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_7_17"> <sup>17</sup>Nevertheless, each person should live as a believer in whatever situation the Lord has assigned to them, just as God has called them. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_18"><sup>18</sup>Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_19"><sup>19</sup>Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God’s commands is what counts. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_20"><sup>20</sup>Each person should remain in the situation they were in when God called them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_21"> <sup>21</sup>Were you a slave when you were called? Don’t let it trouble you—although if you can gain your freedom, do so. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_22"><sup>22</sup>For the one who was a slave when called to faith in the Lord is the Lord’s freed person; similarly, the one who was free when called is Christ’s slave. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_23"><sup>23</sup>You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of human beings. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_24"><sup>24</sup>Brothers and sisters, each person, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation they were in when God called them. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Concerning the Unmarried </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_7_25"> <sup>25</sup>Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_26"><sup>26</sup>Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_27"><sup>27</sup>Are you pledged to a woman? Do not seek to be released. Are you free from such a commitment? Do not look for a wife. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_28"><sup>28</sup>But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_29"> <sup>29</sup>What I mean, brothers and sisters, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they do not; </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_30"><sup>30</sup>those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_31"><sup>31</sup>those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_32"> <sup>32</sup>I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord’s affairs—how he can please the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_33"><sup>33</sup>But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world—how he can please his wife— </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_34"><sup>34</sup>and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord’s affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world—how she can please her husband. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_35"><sup>35</sup>I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_36"> <sup>36</sup>If anyone is worried that he might not be acting honorably toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if his passions are too strong<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or if she is getting beyond the usual age for marriage">⚓</a> and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_37"><sup>37</sup>But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin—this man also does the right thing. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_38"><sup>38</sup>So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does better.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or 36If anyone thinks he is not treating his daughter properly, and if she is getting along in years (or if her passions are too strong ), and he feels she ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. He should let her get married. 37But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind to keep the virgin unmarried—this man also does the right thing. 38So then, he who gives his virgin in marriage does right, but he who does not give her in marriage does better.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_39"> <sup>39</sup>A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_40"><sup>40</sup>In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is—and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. <br/></span>
