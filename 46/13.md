<div class="title"><h1>13</h1><h3>Love Is Indispensable </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_13_1"> <sup>1</sup>If I speak in the tongues<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or languages">⚓</a> of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_13_2"><sup>2</sup>If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_13_3"><sup>3</sup>If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts body to the flames">⚓</a> but do not have love, I gain nothing. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_13_4"> <sup>4</sup>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_13_5"><sup>5</sup>It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_13_6"><sup>6</sup>Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_13_7"><sup>7</sup>It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_13_8"> <sup>8</sup>Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_13_9"><sup>9</sup>For we know in part and we prophesy in part, </span>
<span class="verse 1co_13_10"><sup>10</sup>but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_13_11"><sup>11</sup>When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_13_12"><sup>12</sup>For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_13_13"> <sup>13</sup>And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. <br/></span>
