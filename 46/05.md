<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>Dealing With a Case of Incest </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that even pagans do not tolerate: A man is sleeping with his father’s wife. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_2"><sup>2</sup>And you are proud! Shouldn’t you rather have gone into mourning and have put out of your fellowship the man who has been doing this? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_3"><sup>3</sup>For my part, even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit. As one who is present with you in this way, I have already passed judgment in the name of our Lord Jesus on the one who has been doing this. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_4"><sup>4</sup>So when you are assembled and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present, </span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_5"><sup>5</sup>hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="In contexts like this, the Greek word for flesh (sarx ) refers to the sinful state of human beings, often presented as a power in opposition to the Spirit.">⚓</a><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or of his body">⚓</a> so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_6"> <sup>6</sup>Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_7"><sup>7</sup>Get rid of the old yeast, so that you may be a new unleavened batch—as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_8"><sup>8</sup>Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old bread leavened with malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_9"> <sup>9</sup>I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people— </span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_10"><sup>10</sup>not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_11"><sup>11</sup>But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek word for brother or sister (adelphos ) refers here to a believer, whether man or woman, as part of God’s family; also in 8:11, 13.">⚓</a> but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Do not even eat with such people. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_12"> <sup>12</sup>What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_13"><sup>13</sup>God will judge those outside. “Expel the wicked person from among you.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 13:5; 17:7; 19:19; 21:21; 22:21,24; 24:7">⚓</a><br/></span>
