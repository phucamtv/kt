<div class="title"><h1>10</h1><h3>Warnings From Israel’s History </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_10_1"> <sup>1</sup>For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_2"><sup>2</sup>They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_3"><sup>3</sup>They all ate the same spiritual food </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_4"><sup>4</sup>and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_5"><sup>5</sup>Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were scattered in the wilderness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_6"> <sup>6</sup>Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_7"><sup>7</sup>Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: “The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Exodus 32:6">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_8"><sup>8</sup>We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did—and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_9"><sup>9</sup>We should not test Christ,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts test the Lord">⚓</a> as some of them did—and were killed by snakes. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_10"><sup>10</sup>And do not grumble, as some of them did—and were killed by the destroying angel. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_11"> <sup>11</sup>These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the culmination of the ages has come. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_12"><sup>12</sup>So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don’t fall! </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_13"><sup>13</sup>No temptation<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek for temptation and tempted can also mean testing and tested .">⚓</a> has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek for temptation and tempted can also mean testing and tested .">⚓</a> beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek for temptation and tempted can also mean testing and tested .">⚓</a> he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Idol Feasts and the Lord’s Supper </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_10_14"> <sup>14</sup>Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_15"><sup>15</sup>I speak to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_16"><sup>16</sup>Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_17"><sup>17</sup>Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all share the one loaf. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_18"> <sup>18</sup>Consider the people of Israel: Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_19"><sup>19</sup>Do I mean then that food sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_20"><sup>20</sup>No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to be participants with demons. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_21"><sup>21</sup>You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord’s table and the table of demons. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_22"><sup>22</sup>Are we trying to arouse the Lord’s jealousy? Are we stronger than he? <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Believer’s Freedom </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_10_23"> <sup>23</sup>“I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is beneficial. “I have the right to do anything”—but not everything is constructive. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_24"><sup>24</sup>No one should seek their own good, but the good of others. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_25"> <sup>25</sup>Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience, </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_26"><sup>26</sup>for, “The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 24:1">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_27"> <sup>27</sup>If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_28"><sup>28</sup>But if someone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it, both for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_29"><sup>29</sup>I am referring to the other person’s conscience, not yours. For why is my freedom being judged by another’s conscience? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_30"><sup>30</sup>If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of something I thank God for? <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_31"> <sup>31</sup>So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_32"><sup>32</sup>Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God— </span>
<span class="verse 1co_10_33"><sup>33</sup>even as I try to please everyone in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved. <br/></span>
