<div class="title"><h1>16</h1><h3>The Collection for the Lord’s People </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_16_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now about the collection for the Lord’s people: Do what I told the Galatian churches to do. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_2"><sup>2</sup>On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with your income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_3"><sup>3</sup>Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_4"><sup>4</sup>If it seems advisable for me to go also, they will accompany me. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Personal Requests </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_16_5"> <sup>5</sup>After I go through Macedonia, I will come to you—for I will be going through Macedonia. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_6"><sup>6</sup>Perhaps I will stay with you for a while, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_7"><sup>7</sup>For I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_8"><sup>8</sup>But I will stay on at Ephesus until Pentecost, </span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_9"><sup>9</sup>because a great door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many who oppose me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_10"> <sup>10</sup>When Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is carrying on the work of the Lord, just as I am. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_11"><sup>11</sup>No one, then, should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he may return to me. I am expecting him along with the brothers. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_12"> <sup>12</sup>Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was quite unwilling to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_13"> <sup>13</sup>Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_14"><sup>14</sup>Do everything in love. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_15"> <sup>15</sup>You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the Lord’s people. I urge you, brothers and sisters, </span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_16"><sup>16</sup>to submit to such people and to everyone who joins in the work and labors at it. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_17"><sup>17</sup>I was glad when Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_18"><sup>18</sup>For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Such men deserve recognition. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Final Greetings </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_16_19"> <sup>19</sup>The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Greek Prisca , a variant of Priscilla">⚓</a> greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_20"><sup>20</sup>All the brothers and sisters here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_21"> <sup>21</sup>I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_22"> <sup>22</sup>If anyone does not love the Lord, let that person be cursed! Come, Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek for Come, Lord reproduces an Aramaic expression (Marana tha ) used by early Christians.">⚓</a> ! <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_23"> <sup>23</sup>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_16_24"> <sup>24</sup>My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts do not have Amen .">⚓</a><br/></span>
