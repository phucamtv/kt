<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>The Temple’s Furnishings </h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>He made a bronze altar twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 30 feet long and wide and 15 feet high or about 9 meters long and wide and 4.5 meters high">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_2"><sup>2</sup>He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 7 1/2 feet or about 2.3 meters">⚓</a> high. It took a line of thirty cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 45 feet or about 14 meters">⚓</a> to measure around it. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_3"><sup>3</sup>Below the rim, figures of bulls encircled it—ten to a cubit.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 18 inches or about 45 centimeters">⚓</a> The bulls were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_4"> <sup>4</sup>The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_5"><sup>5</sup>It was a handbreadth<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 3 inches or about 7.5 centimeters">⚓</a> in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held three thousand baths.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 18,000 gallons or about 66,000 liters">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_6"> <sup>6</sup>He then made ten basins for washing and placed five on the south side and five on the north. In them the things to be used for the burnt offerings were rinsed, but the Sea was to be used by the priests for washing. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_7"> <sup>7</sup>He made ten gold lampstands according to the specifications for them and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_8"> <sup>8</sup>He made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. He also made a hundred gold sprinkling bowls. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_9"> <sup>9</sup>He made the courtyard of the priests, and the large court and the doors for the court, and overlaid the doors with bronze. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_10"><sup>10</sup>He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_11"> <sup>11</sup>And Huram also made the pots and shovels and sprinkling bowls. <br/> So Huram finished the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of God: <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_12">  <sup>12</sup>the two pillars; <br/>  the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; <br/>  the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_13">  <sup>13</sup>the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network, decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars); <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_14">  <sup>14</sup>the stands with their basins; <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_15">  <sup>15</sup>the Sea and the twelve bulls under it; <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_16">  <sup>16</sup>the pots, shovels, meat forks and all related articles. <br/> All the objects that Huram-Abi made for King Solomon for the temple of the Lord were of polished bronze. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_17"><sup>17</sup>The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Sukkoth and Zarethan.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew Zeredatha, a variant of Zarethan">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_18"><sup>18</sup>All these things that Solomon made amounted to so much that the weight of the bronze could not be calculated. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_19"> <sup>19</sup>Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in God’s temple: <br/>  the golden altar; <br/>  the tables on which was the bread of the Presence; <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_20">  <sup>20</sup>the lampstands of pure gold with their lamps, to burn in front of the inner sanctuary as prescribed; <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_21">  <sup>21</sup>the gold floral work and lamps and tongs (they were solid gold); <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_22">  <sup>22</sup>the pure gold wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers; and the gold doors of the temple: the inner doors to the Most Holy Place and the doors of the main hall. <br/></span>
