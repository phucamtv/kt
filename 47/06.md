<span class="verse 2co_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>As God’s co-workers we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain. </span>

<div class="title"><h3>Paul’s Hardships </h3></div>
<span class="verse 2co_6_3"> <sup>3</sup>We put no stumbling block in anyone’s path, so that our ministry will not be discredited. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_6_4"><sup>4</sup>Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses; </span>
<span class="verse 2co_6_5"><sup>5</sup>in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights and hunger; </span>
<span class="verse 2co_6_6"><sup>6</sup>in purity, understanding, patience and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love; </span>
<span class="verse 2co_6_7"><sup>7</sup>in truthful speech and in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left; </span>
<span class="verse 2co_6_8"><sup>8</sup>through glory and dishonor, bad report and good report; genuine, yet regarded as impostors; </span>
<span class="verse 2co_6_9"><sup>9</sup>known, yet regarded as unknown; dying, and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not killed; </span>
<span class="verse 2co_6_10"><sup>10</sup>sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2co_6_11"> <sup>11</sup>We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_6_12"><sup>12</sup>We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_6_13"><sup>13</sup>As a fair exchange—I speak as to my children—open wide your hearts also. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Warning Against Idolatry </h3></div>
<span class="verse 2co_6_14"> <sup>14</sup>Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? </span>
<span class="verse 2co_6_15"><sup>15</sup>What harmony is there between Christ and Belial<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Greek Beliar , a variant of Belial">⚓</a> ? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? </span>
<span class="verse 2co_6_16"><sup>16</sup>What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: <br/>  “I will live with them <br/>   and walk among them, <br/>  and I will be their God, <br/>   and they will be my people.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:12; Jer. 32:38; Ezek. 37:27">⚓</a><br/></span>

<span class="verse 2co_6_18"><sup>18</sup>And, <br/>  “I will be a Father to you, <br/>   and you will be my sons and daughters, <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">says the Lord Almighty.” </aside><br/></span>
