<span class="verse 2sa_22_3">   <sup>3</sup>my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, <br/>   my shield<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or sovereign">⚓</a> and the horn<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="here symbolizes strength.">⚓</a> of my salvation. <br/>  He is my stronghold, my refuge and my savior— <br/>   from violent people you save me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_4">  <sup>4</sup>“I called to the Lord, who is worthy of praise, <br/>   and have been saved from my enemies. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_5">  <sup>5</sup>The waves of death swirled about me; <br/>   the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_6">  <sup>6</sup>The cords of the grave coiled around me; <br/>   the snares of death confronted me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_7">  <sup>7</sup>“In my distress I called to the Lord; <br/>   I called out to my God. <br/>  From his temple he heard my voice; <br/>   my cry came to his ears. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_8">  <sup>8</sup>The earth trembled and quaked, <br/>   the foundations of the heavens<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew; Vulgate and Syriac (see also Psalm 18:7) mountains">⚓</a> shook; <br/>   they trembled because he was angry. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_9">  <sup>9</sup>Smoke rose from his nostrils; <br/>   consuming fire came from his mouth, <br/>   burning coals blazed out of it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_10">  <sup>10</sup>He parted the heavens and came down; <br/>   dark clouds were under his feet. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_11">  <sup>11</sup>He mounted the cherubim and flew; <br/>   he soared<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Many Hebrew manuscripts (see also Psalm 18:10); most Hebrew manuscripts appeared">⚓</a> on the wings of the wind. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_12">  <sup>12</sup>He made darkness his canopy around him— <br/>   the dark<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint (see also Psalm 18:11); Hebrew massed">⚓</a> rain clouds of the sky. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_13">  <sup>13</sup>Out of the brightness of his presence <br/>   bolts of lightning blazed forth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_14">  <sup>14</sup>The Lord thundered from heaven; <br/>   the voice of the Most High resounded. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_15">  <sup>15</sup>He shot his arrows and scattered the enemy, <br/>   with great bolts of lightning he routed them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_16">  <sup>16</sup>The valleys of the sea were exposed <br/>   and the foundations of the earth laid bare <br/>  at the rebuke of the Lord, <br/>   at the blast of breath from his nostrils. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_17">  <sup>17</sup>“He reached down from on high and took hold of me; <br/>   he drew me out of deep waters. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_18">  <sup>18</sup>He rescued me from my powerful enemy, <br/>   from my foes, who were too strong for me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_19">  <sup>19</sup>They confronted me in the day of my disaster, <br/>   but the Lord was my support. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_20">  <sup>20</sup>He brought me out into a spacious place; <br/>   he rescued me because he delighted in me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_21">  <sup>21</sup>“The Lord has dealt with me according to my righteousness; <br/>   according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_22">  <sup>22</sup>For I have kept the ways of the Lord; <br/>   I am not guilty of turning from my God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_23">  <sup>23</sup>All his laws are before me; <br/>   I have not turned away from his decrees. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_24">  <sup>24</sup>I have been blameless before him <br/>   and have kept myself from sin. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_25">  <sup>25</sup>The Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness, <br/>   according to my cleanness<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew; Septuagint and Vulgate (see also Psalm 18:24) to the cleanness of my hands">⚓</a> in his sight. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_26">  <sup>26</sup>“To the faithful you show yourself faithful, <br/>   to the blameless you show yourself blameless, <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_27">  <sup>27</sup>to the pure you show yourself pure, <br/>   but to the devious you show yourself shrewd. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_28">  <sup>28</sup>You save the humble, <br/>   but your eyes are on the haughty to bring them low. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_29">  <sup>29</sup>You, Lord, are my lamp; <br/>   the Lord turns my darkness into light. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_30">  <sup>30</sup>With your help I can advance against a troop<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or can run through a barricade">⚓</a> ; <br/>   with my God I can scale a wall. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_31">  <sup>31</sup>“As for God, his way is perfect: <br/>   The Lord’s word is flawless; <br/>   he shields all who take refuge in him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_32">  <sup>32</sup>For who is God besides the Lord? <br/>   And who is the Rock except our God? <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_33">  <sup>33</sup>It is God who arms me with strength<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dead Sea Scrolls, some Septuagint manuscripts, Vulgate and Syriac (see also Psalm 18:32); Masoretic Text who is my strong refuge">⚓</a><br/>   and keeps my way secure. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_34">  <sup>34</sup>He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; <br/>   he causes me to stand on the heights. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_35">  <sup>35</sup>He trains my hands for battle; <br/>   my arms can bend a bow of bronze. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_36">  <sup>36</sup>You make your saving help my shield; <br/>   your help has made<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dead Sea Scrolls; Masoretic Text shield; / you stoop down to make">⚓</a> me great. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_37">  <sup>37</sup>You provide a broad path for my feet, <br/>   so that my ankles do not give way. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_38">  <sup>38</sup>“I pursued my enemies and crushed them; <br/>   I did not turn back till they were destroyed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_39">  <sup>39</sup>I crushed them completely, and they could not rise; <br/>   they fell beneath my feet. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_40">  <sup>40</sup>You armed me with strength for battle; <br/>   you humbled my adversaries before me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_41">  <sup>41</sup>You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, <br/>   and I destroyed my foes. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_42">  <sup>42</sup>They cried for help, but there was no one to save them— <br/>   to the Lord, but he did not answer. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_43">  <sup>43</sup>I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth; <br/>   I pounded and trampled them like mud in the streets. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_44">  <sup>44</sup>“You have delivered me from the attacks of the peoples; <br/>   you have preserved me as the head of nations. <br/>  People I did not know now serve me, <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_45">   <sup>45</sup>foreigners cower before me; <br/>   as soon as they hear of me, they obey me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_46">  <sup>46</sup>They all lose heart; <br/>   they come trembling<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some Septuagint manuscripts and Vulgate (see also Psalm 18:45); Masoretic Text they arm themselves">⚓</a> from their strongholds. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_47">  <sup>47</sup>“The Lord lives! Praise be to my Rock! <br/>   Exalted be my God, the Rock, my Savior! <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_48">  <sup>48</sup>He is the God who avenges me, <br/>   who puts the nations under me, <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_49">   <sup>49</sup>who sets me free from my enemies. <br/>  You exalted me above my foes; <br/>   from a violent man you rescued me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_50">  <sup>50</sup>Therefore I will praise you, Lord, among the nations; <br/>   I will sing the praises of your name. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_22_51">  <sup>51</sup>“He gives his king great victories; <br/>   he shows unfailing kindness to his anointed, <br/>   to David and his descendants forever.” <br/></span>
