<div class="title"><h1>23</h1><h3>David’s Last Words </h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_1"> <sup>1</sup>These are the last words of David: <br/>  “The inspired utterance of David son of Jesse, <br/>   the utterance of the man exalted by the Most High, <br/>  the man anointed by the God of Jacob, <br/>   the hero of Israel’s songs: <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_2">  <sup>2</sup>“The Spirit of the Lord spoke through me; <br/>   his word was on my tongue. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_3">  <sup>3</sup>The God of Israel spoke, <br/>   the Rock of Israel said to me: <br/>  ‘When one rules over people in righteousness, <br/>   when he rules in the fear of God, <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_4">  <sup>4</sup>he is like the light of morning at sunrise <br/>   on a cloudless morning, <br/>  like the brightness after rain <br/>   that brings grass from the earth.’ <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_5">  <sup>5</sup>“If my house were not right with God, <br/>   surely he would not have made with me an everlasting covenant, <br/>   arranged and secured in every part; <br/>  surely he would not bring to fruition my salvation <br/>   and grant me my every desire. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_6">  <sup>6</sup>But evil men are all to be cast aside like thorns, <br/>   which are not gathered with the hand. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_7">  <sup>7</sup>Whoever touches thorns <br/>   uses a tool of iron or the shaft of a spear; <br/>   they are burned up where they lie.” <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>David’s Mighty Warriors </h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_8"> <sup>8</sup>These are the names of David’s mighty warriors: <br/> Josheb-Basshebeth,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew; some Septuagint manuscripts suggest Ish-Bosheth, that is, Esh-Baal (see also 1 Chron. 11:11 Jashobeam ).">⚓</a> a Tahkemonite,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Probably a variant of Hakmonite (see 1 Chron. 11:11)">⚓</a> was chief of the Three; he raised his spear against eight hundred men, whom he killed<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some Septuagint manuscripts (see also 1 Chron. 11:11); Hebrew and other Septuagint manuscripts Three; it was Adino the Eznite who killed eight hundred men">⚓</a> in one encounter. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_9"> <sup>9</sup>Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite. As one of the three mighty warriors, he was with David when they taunted the Philistines gathered at Pas Dammim<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="See 1 Chron. 11:13; Hebrew gathered there .">⚓</a> for battle. Then the Israelites retreated, </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_10"><sup>10</sup>but Eleazar stood his ground and struck down the Philistines till his hand grew tired and froze to the sword. The Lord brought about a great victory that day. The troops returned to Eleazar, but only to strip the dead. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_11"> <sup>11</sup>Next to him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines banded together at a place where there was a field full of lentils, Israel’s troops fled from them. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_12"><sup>12</sup>But Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field. He defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the Lord brought about a great victory. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_13"> <sup>13</sup>During harvest time, three of the thirty chief warriors came down to David at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_14"><sup>14</sup>At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_15"><sup>15</sup>David longed for water and said, “Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_16"><sup>16</sup>So the three mighty warriors broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_17"><sup>17</sup>“Far be it from me, Lord, to do this!” he said. “Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives?” And David would not drink it. <br/> Such were the exploits of the three mighty warriors. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_18"> <sup>18</sup>Abishai the brother of Joab son of Zeruiah was chief of the Three.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Most Hebrew manuscripts (see also 1 Chron. 11:20); two Hebrew manuscripts and Syriac Thirty">⚓</a> He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_19"><sup>19</sup>Was he not held in greater honor than the Three? He became their commander, even though he was not included among them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_20"> <sup>20</sup>Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, performed great exploits. He struck down Moab’s two mightiest warriors. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_21"><sup>21</sup>And he struck down a huge Egyptian. Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_22"><sup>22</sup>Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty warriors. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_23_23"><sup>23</sup>He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard. <br/></span>
