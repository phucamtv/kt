<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Instructions on Worship </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1ti_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people— </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_2_2"><sup>2</sup>for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_2_3"><sup>3</sup>This is good, and pleases God our Savior, </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_2_4"><sup>4</sup>who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_2_5"><sup>5</sup>For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_2_6"><sup>6</sup>who gave himself as a ransom for all people. This has now been witnessed to at the proper time. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_2_7"><sup>7</sup>And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle—I am telling the truth, I am not lying—and a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1ti_2_8"> <sup>8</sup>Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_2_9"><sup>9</sup>I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_2_10"><sup>10</sup>but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1ti_2_11"> <sup>11</sup>A woman<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or wife ; also in verse 12">⚓</a> should learn in quietness and full submission. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_2_12"><sup>12</sup>I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man;<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or over her husband">⚓</a> she must be quiet. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_2_13"><sup>13</sup>For Adam was formed first, then Eve. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_2_14"><sup>14</sup>And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_2_15"><sup>15</sup>But women<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Greek she">⚓</a> will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. <br/></span>
