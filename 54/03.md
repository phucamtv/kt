<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>Qualifications for Overseers and Deacons </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>Here is a trustworthy saying: Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_2"><sup>2</sup>Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_3"><sup>3</sup>not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_4"><sup>4</sup>He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a manner worthy of full<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or him with proper">⚓</a> respect. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_5"><sup>5</sup>(If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God’s church?) </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_6"><sup>6</sup>He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_7"><sup>7</sup>He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil’s trap. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_8"> <sup>8</sup>In the same way, deacons<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The word deacons refers here to Christians designated to serve with the overseers/elders of the church in a variety of ways; similarly in verse 12; Romans 16:1 and Phil. 1:1.">⚓</a> are to be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_9"><sup>9</sup>They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_10"><sup>10</sup>They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_11"> <sup>11</sup>In the same way, the women<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Possibly deacons’ wives or women who are deacons">⚓</a> are to be worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_12"> <sup>12</sup>A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_13"><sup>13</sup>Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Reasons for Paul’s Instructions </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_14"> <sup>14</sup>Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that, </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_15"><sup>15</sup>if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God’s household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_16"><sup>16</sup>Beyond all question, the mystery from which true godliness springs is great: <br/>  He appeared in the flesh, <br/>   was vindicated by the Spirit,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or vindicated in spirit">⚓</a><br/>  was seen by angels, <br/>   was preached among the nations, <br/>  was believed on in the world, <br/>   was taken up in glory. <br/></span>
