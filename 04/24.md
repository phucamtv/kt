<span class="verse dan_24_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he did not resort to divination as at other times, but turned his face toward the wilderness. </span>
<span class="verse dan_24_2"><sup>2</sup>When Balaam looked out and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came on him </span>
<span class="verse dan_24_3"><sup>3</sup>and he spoke his message: <br/>  “The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, <br/>   the prophecy of one whose eye sees clearly, <br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_4">  <sup>4</sup>the prophecy of one who hears the words of God, <br/>   who sees a vision from the Almighty,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew Shaddai ; also in verse 16">⚓</a><br/>   who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened: <br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_5">  <sup>5</sup>“How beautiful are your tents, Jacob, <br/>   your dwelling places, Israel! <br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_6">  <sup>6</sup>“Like valleys they spread out, <br/>   like gardens beside a river, <br/>  like aloes planted by the Lord, <br/>   like cedars beside the waters. <br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_7">  <sup>7</sup>Water will flow from their buckets; <br/>   their seed will have abundant water. <br/>  “Their king will be greater than Agag; <br/>   their kingdom will be exalted. <br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_8">  <sup>8</sup>“God brought them out of Egypt; <br/>   they have the strength of a wild ox. <br/>  They devour hostile nations <br/>   and break their bones in pieces; <br/>   with their arrows they pierce them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_9">  <sup>9</sup>Like a lion they crouch and lie down, <br/>   like a lioness—who dares to rouse them? <br/>  “May those who bless you be blessed <br/>   and those who curse you be cursed!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then Balak’s anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together and said to him, “I summoned you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them these three times. </span>
<span class="verse dan_24_11"><sup>11</sup>Now leave at once and go home! I said I would reward you handsomely, but the Lord has kept you from being rewarded.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_12"> <sup>12</sup>Balaam answered Balak, “Did I not tell the messengers you sent me, </span>
<span class="verse dan_24_13"><sup>13</sup>‘Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the Lord—and I must say only what the Lord says’? </span>
<span class="verse dan_24_14"><sup>14</sup>Now I am going back to my people, but come, let me warn you of what this people will do to your people in days to come.” <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Balaam’s Fourth Message </h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_24_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then he spoke his message: <br/>  “The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, <br/>   the prophecy of one whose eye sees clearly, <br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_16">  <sup>16</sup>the prophecy of one who hears the words of God, <br/>   who has knowledge from the Most High, <br/>  who sees a vision from the Almighty, <br/>   who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened: <br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_17">  <sup>17</sup>“I see him, but not now; <br/>   I behold him, but not near. <br/>  A star will come out of Jacob; <br/>   a scepter will rise out of Israel. <br/>  He will crush the foreheads of Moab, <br/>   the skulls<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Samaritan Pentateuch (see also Jer. 48:45); the meaning of the word in the Masoretic Text is uncertain.">⚓</a> of<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or possibly Moab, / batter">⚓</a> all the people of Sheth.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or all the noisy boasters">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_18">  <sup>18</sup>Edom will be conquered; <br/>   Seir, his enemy, will be conquered, <br/>   but Israel will grow strong. <br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_19">  <sup>19</sup>A ruler will come out of Jacob <br/>   and destroy the survivors of the city.” <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Balaam’s Fifth Message </h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_24_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then Balaam saw Amalek and spoke his message: <br/>  “Amalek was first among the nations, <br/>   but their end will be utter destruction.” <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Balaam’s Sixth Message </h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_24_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then he saw the Kenites and spoke his message: <br/>  “Your dwelling place is secure, <br/>   your nest is set in a rock; <br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_22">  <sup>22</sup>yet you Kenites will be destroyed <br/>   when Ashur takes you captive.” <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Balaam’s Seventh Message </h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_24_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then he spoke his message: <br/>  “Alas! Who can live when God does this?<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Masoretic Text; with a different word division of the Hebrew The people from the islands will gather from the north .">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_24">   <sup>24</sup>Ships will come from the shores of Cyprus; <br/>  they will subdue Ashur and Eber, <br/>   but they too will come to ruin.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then Balaam got up and returned home, and Balak went his own way. <br/></span>
