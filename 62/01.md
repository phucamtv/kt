<div class="title"><h1>1</h1><h3>The Incarnation of the Word of Life </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1gi_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched—this we proclaim concerning the Word of life. </span>
<span class="verse 1gi_1_2"><sup>2</sup>The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us. </span>
<span class="verse 1gi_1_3"><sup>3</sup>We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class="verse 1gi_1_4"><sup>4</sup>We write this to make our<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts your">⚓</a> joy complete. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Light and Darkness, Sin and Forgiveness </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1gi_1_5"> <sup>5</sup>This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all. </span>
<span class="verse 1gi_1_6"><sup>6</sup>If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth. </span>
<span class="verse 1gi_1_7"><sup>7</sup>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or every">⚓</a> sin. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1gi_1_8"> <sup>8</sup>If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. </span>
<span class="verse 1gi_1_9"><sup>9</sup>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. </span>
<span class="verse 1gi_1_10"><sup>10</sup>If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us. <br/></span>
