<span class="verse ca_3_1">  <sup>1</sup>I am the man who has seen affliction <br/>   by the rod of the Lord’s wrath. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_2">  <sup>2</sup>He has driven me away and made me walk <br/>   in darkness rather than light; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_3">  <sup>3</sup>indeed, he has turned his hand against me <br/>   again and again, all day long. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_4">  <sup>4</sup>He has made my skin and my flesh grow old <br/>   and has broken my bones. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_5">  <sup>5</sup>He has besieged me and surrounded me <br/>   with bitterness and hardship. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_6">  <sup>6</sup>He has made me dwell in darkness <br/>   like those long dead. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_7">  <sup>7</sup>He has walled me in so I cannot escape; <br/>   he has weighed me down with chains. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_8">  <sup>8</sup>Even when I call out or cry for help, <br/>   he shuts out my prayer. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_9">  <sup>9</sup>He has barred my way with blocks of stone; <br/>   he has made my paths crooked. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_10">  <sup>10</sup>Like a bear lying in wait, <br/>   like a lion in hiding, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_11">  <sup>11</sup>he dragged me from the path and mangled me <br/>   and left me without help. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_12">  <sup>12</sup>He drew his bow <br/>   and made me the target for his arrows. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_13">  <sup>13</sup>He pierced my heart <br/>   with arrows from his quiver. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_14">  <sup>14</sup>I became the laughingstock of all my people; <br/>   they mock me in song all day long. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_15">  <sup>15</sup>He has filled me with bitter herbs <br/>   and given me gall to drink. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_16">  <sup>16</sup>He has broken my teeth with gravel; <br/>   he has trampled me in the dust. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_17">  <sup>17</sup>I have been deprived of peace; <br/>   I have forgotten what prosperity is. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_18">  <sup>18</sup>So I say, “My splendor is gone <br/>   and all that I had hoped from the Lord.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_19">  <sup>19</sup>I remember my affliction and my wandering, <br/>   the bitterness and the gall. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_20">  <sup>20</sup>I well remember them, <br/>   and my soul is downcast within me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_21">  <sup>21</sup>Yet this I call to mind <br/>   and therefore I have hope: <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_22">  <sup>22</sup>Because of the Lord’s great love we are not consumed, <br/>   for his compassions never fail. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_23">  <sup>23</sup>They are new every morning; <br/>   great is your faithfulness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_24">  <sup>24</sup>I say to myself, “The Lord is my portion; <br/>   therefore I will wait for him.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_25">  <sup>25</sup>The Lord is good to those whose hope is in him, <br/>   to the one who seeks him; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_26">  <sup>26</sup>it is good to wait quietly <br/>   for the salvation of the Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_27">  <sup>27</sup>It is good for a man to bear the yoke <br/>   while he is young. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_28">  <sup>28</sup>Let him sit alone in silence, <br/>   for the Lord has laid it on him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_29">  <sup>29</sup>Let him bury his face in the dust— <br/>   there may yet be hope. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_30">  <sup>30</sup>Let him offer his cheek to one who would strike him, <br/>   and let him be filled with disgrace. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_31">  <sup>31</sup>For no one is cast off <br/>   by the Lord forever. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_32">  <sup>32</sup>Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, <br/>   so great is his unfailing love. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_33">  <sup>33</sup>For he does not willingly bring affliction <br/>   or grief to anyone. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_34">  <sup>34</sup>To crush underfoot <br/>   all prisoners in the land, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_35">  <sup>35</sup>to deny people their rights <br/>   before the Most High, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_36">  <sup>36</sup>to deprive them of justice— <br/>   would not the Lord see such things? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_37">  <sup>37</sup>Who can speak and have it happen <br/>   if the Lord has not decreed it? <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_38">  <sup>38</sup>Is it not from the mouth of the Most High <br/>   that both calamities and good things come? <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_39">  <sup>39</sup>Why should the living complain <br/>   when punished for their sins? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_40">  <sup>40</sup>Let us examine our ways and test them, <br/>   and let us return to the Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_41">  <sup>41</sup>Let us lift up our hearts and our hands <br/>   to God in heaven, and say: <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_42">  <sup>42</sup>“We have sinned and rebelled <br/>   and you have not forgiven. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_43">  <sup>43</sup>“You have covered yourself with anger and pursued us; <br/>   you have slain without pity. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_44">  <sup>44</sup>You have covered yourself with a cloud <br/>   so that no prayer can get through. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_45">  <sup>45</sup>You have made us scum and refuse <br/>   among the nations. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_46">  <sup>46</sup>“All our enemies have opened their mouths <br/>   wide against us. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_47">  <sup>47</sup>We have suffered terror and pitfalls, <br/>   ruin and destruction.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_48">  <sup>48</sup>Streams of tears flow from my eyes <br/>   because my people are destroyed. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_49">  <sup>49</sup>My eyes will flow unceasingly, <br/>   without relief, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_50">  <sup>50</sup>until the Lord looks down <br/>   from heaven and sees. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_51">  <sup>51</sup>What I see brings grief to my soul <br/>   because of all the women of my city. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_52">  <sup>52</sup>Those who were my enemies without cause <br/>   hunted me like a bird. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_53">  <sup>53</sup>They tried to end my life in a pit <br/>   and threw stones at me; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_54">  <sup>54</sup>the waters closed over my head, <br/>   and I thought I was about to perish. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_55">  <sup>55</sup>I called on your name, Lord, <br/>   from the depths of the pit. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_56">  <sup>56</sup>You heard my plea: “Do not close your ears <br/>   to my cry for relief.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_57">  <sup>57</sup>You came near when I called you, <br/>   and you said, “Do not fear.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_58">  <sup>58</sup>You, Lord, took up my case; <br/>   you redeemed my life. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_59">  <sup>59</sup>Lord, you have seen the wrong done to me. <br/>   Uphold my cause! <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_60">  <sup>60</sup>You have seen the depth of their vengeance, <br/>   all their plots against me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_61">  <sup>61</sup>Lord, you have heard their insults, <br/>   all their plots against me— <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_62">  <sup>62</sup>what my enemies whisper and mutter <br/>   against me all day long. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_63">  <sup>63</sup>Look at them! Sitting or standing, <br/>   they mock me in their songs. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_64">  <sup>64</sup>Pay them back what they deserve, Lord, <br/>   for what their hands have done. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_65">  <sup>65</sup>Put a veil over their hearts, <br/>   and may your curse be on them! <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_3_66">  <sup>66</sup>Pursue them in anger and destroy them <br/>   from under the heavens of the Lord. <br/><br/></span>
