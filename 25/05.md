<span class="verse ca_5_2">  <sup>2</sup>Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, <br/>   our homes to foreigners. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_3">  <sup>3</sup>We have become fatherless, <br/>   our mothers are widows. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_4">  <sup>4</sup>We must buy the water we drink; <br/>   our wood can be had only at a price. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_5">  <sup>5</sup>Those who pursue us are at our heels; <br/>   we are weary and find no rest. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_6">  <sup>6</sup>We submitted to Egypt and Assyria <br/>   to get enough bread. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_7">  <sup>7</sup>Our ancestors sinned and are no more, <br/>   and we bear their punishment. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_8">  <sup>8</sup>Slaves rule over us, <br/>   and there is no one to free us from their hands. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_9">  <sup>9</sup>We get our bread at the risk of our lives <br/>   because of the sword in the desert. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_10">  <sup>10</sup>Our skin is hot as an oven, <br/>   feverish from hunger. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_11">  <sup>11</sup>Women have been violated in Zion, <br/>   and virgins in the towns of Judah. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_12">  <sup>12</sup>Princes have been hung up by their hands; <br/>   elders are shown no respect. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_13">  <sup>13</sup>Young men toil at the millstones; <br/>   boys stagger under loads of wood. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_14">  <sup>14</sup>The elders are gone from the city gate; <br/>   the young men have stopped their music. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_15">  <sup>15</sup>Joy is gone from our hearts; <br/>   our dancing has turned to mourning. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_16">  <sup>16</sup>The crown has fallen from our head. <br/>   Woe to us, for we have sinned! <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_17">  <sup>17</sup>Because of this our hearts are faint, <br/>   because of these things our eyes grow dim <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_18">  <sup>18</sup>for Mount Zion, which lies desolate, <br/>   with jackals prowling over it. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_19">  <sup>19</sup>You, Lord, reign forever; <br/>   your throne endures from generation to generation. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_20">  <sup>20</sup>Why do you always forget us? <br/>   Why do you forsake us so long? <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_21">  <sup>21</sup>Restore us to yourself, Lord, that we may return; <br/>   renew our days as of old <br/></span>
<span class="verse ca_5_22">  <sup>22</sup>unless you have utterly rejected us <br/>   and are angry with us beyond measure. <br/></span>
