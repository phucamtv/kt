<div class="title"><h1>9</h1><h3>Job </h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Job replied: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_2">  <sup>2</sup>“Indeed, I know that this is true. <br/>   But how can mere mortals prove their innocence before God? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_3">  <sup>3</sup>Though they wished to dispute with him, <br/>   they could not answer him one time out of a thousand. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_4">  <sup>4</sup>His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. <br/>   Who has resisted him and come out unscathed? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_5">  <sup>5</sup>He moves mountains without their knowing it <br/>   and overturns them in his anger. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_6">  <sup>6</sup>He shakes the earth from its place <br/>   and makes its pillars tremble. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_7">  <sup>7</sup>He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; <br/>   he seals off the light of the stars. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_8">  <sup>8</sup>He alone stretches out the heavens <br/>   and treads on the waves of the sea. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_9">  <sup>9</sup>He is the Maker of the Bear<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or of Leo">⚓</a> and Orion, <br/>   the Pleiades and the constellations of the south. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_10">  <sup>10</sup>He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, <br/>   miracles that cannot be counted. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_11">  <sup>11</sup>When he passes me, I cannot see him; <br/>   when he goes by, I cannot perceive him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_12">  <sup>12</sup>If he snatches away, who can stop him? <br/>   Who can say to him, ‘What are you doing?’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_13">  <sup>13</sup>God does not restrain his anger; <br/>   even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_14">  <sup>14</sup>“How then can I dispute with him? <br/>   How can I find words to argue with him? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_15">  <sup>15</sup>Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; <br/>   I could only plead with my Judge for mercy. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_16">  <sup>16</sup>Even if I summoned him and he responded, <br/>   I do not believe he would give me a hearing. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_17">  <sup>17</sup>He would crush me with a storm <br/>   and multiply my wounds for no reason. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_18">  <sup>18</sup>He would not let me catch my breath <br/>   but would overwhelm me with misery. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_19">  <sup>19</sup>If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty! <br/>   And if it is a matter of justice, who can challenge him<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="See Septuagint; Hebrew me.">⚓</a> ? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_20">  <sup>20</sup>Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; <br/>   if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_21">  <sup>21</sup>“Although I am blameless, <br/>   I have no concern for myself; <br/>   I despise my own life. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_22">  <sup>22</sup>It is all the same; that is why I say, <br/>   ‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_23">  <sup>23</sup>When a scourge brings sudden death, <br/>   he mocks the despair of the innocent. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_24">  <sup>24</sup>When a land falls into the hands of the wicked, <br/>   he blindfolds its judges. <br/>   If it is not he, then who is it? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_25">  <sup>25</sup>“My days are swifter than a runner; <br/>   they fly away without a glimpse of joy. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_26">  <sup>26</sup>They skim past like boats of papyrus, <br/>   like eagles swooping down on their prey. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_27">  <sup>27</sup>If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint, <br/>   I will change my expression, and smile,’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_28">  <sup>28</sup>I still dread all my sufferings, <br/>   for I know you will not hold me innocent. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_29">  <sup>29</sup>Since I am already found guilty, <br/>   why should I struggle in vain? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_30">  <sup>30</sup>Even if I washed myself with soap <br/>   and my hands with cleansing powder, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_31">  <sup>31</sup>you would plunge me into a slime pit <br/>   so that even my clothes would detest me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_32">  <sup>32</sup>“He is not a mere mortal like me that I might answer him, <br/>   that we might confront each other in court. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_33">  <sup>33</sup>If only there were someone to mediate between us, <br/>   someone to bring us together, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_34">  <sup>34</sup>someone to remove God’s rod from me, <br/>   so that his terror would frighten me no more. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_9_35">  <sup>35</sup>Then I would speak up without fear of him, <br/>   but as it now stands with me, I cannot. <br/><br/></span>
