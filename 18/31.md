<span class="verse giop_31_1">  <sup>1</sup>“I made a covenant with my eyes <br/>   not to look lustfully at a young woman. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_2">  <sup>2</sup>For what is our lot from God above, <br/>   our heritage from the Almighty on high? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_3">  <sup>3</sup>Is it not ruin for the wicked, <br/>   disaster for those who do wrong? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_4">  <sup>4</sup>Does he not see my ways <br/>   and count my every step? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_5">  <sup>5</sup>“If I have walked with falsehood <br/>   or my foot has hurried after deceit— <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_6">  <sup>6</sup>let God weigh me in honest scales <br/>   and he will know that I am blameless— <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_7">  <sup>7</sup>if my steps have turned from the path, <br/>   if my heart has been led by my eyes, <br/>   or if my hands have been defiled, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_8">  <sup>8</sup>then may others eat what I have sown, <br/>   and may my crops be uprooted. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_9">  <sup>9</sup>“If my heart has been enticed by a woman, <br/>   or if I have lurked at my neighbor’s door, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_10">  <sup>10</sup>then may my wife grind another man’s grain, <br/>   and may other men sleep with her. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_11">  <sup>11</sup>For that would have been wicked, <br/>   a sin to be judged. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_12">  <sup>12</sup>It is a fire that burns to Destruction<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew Abaddon">⚓</a> ; <br/>   it would have uprooted my harvest. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_13">  <sup>13</sup>“If I have denied justice to any of my servants, <br/>   whether male or female, <br/>   when they had a grievance against me, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_14">  <sup>14</sup>what will I do when God confronts me? <br/>   What will I answer when called to account? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_15">  <sup>15</sup>Did not he who made me in the womb make them? <br/>   Did not the same one form us both within our mothers? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_16">  <sup>16</sup>“If I have denied the desires of the poor <br/>   or let the eyes of the widow grow weary, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_17">  <sup>17</sup>if I have kept my bread to myself, <br/>   not sharing it with the fatherless— <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_18">  <sup>18</sup>but from my youth I reared them as a father would, <br/>   and from my birth I guided the widow— <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_19">  <sup>19</sup>if I have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing, <br/>   or the needy without garments, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_20">  <sup>20</sup>and their hearts did not bless me <br/>   for warming them with the fleece from my sheep, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_21">  <sup>21</sup>if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, <br/>   knowing that I had influence in court, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_22">  <sup>22</sup>then let my arm fall from the shoulder, <br/>   let it be broken off at the joint. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_23">  <sup>23</sup>For I dreaded destruction from God, <br/>   and for fear of his splendor I could not do such things. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_24">  <sup>24</sup>“If I have put my trust in gold <br/>   or said to pure gold, ‘You are my security,’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_25">  <sup>25</sup>if I have rejoiced over my great wealth, <br/>   the fortune my hands had gained, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_26">  <sup>26</sup>if I have regarded the sun in its radiance <br/>   or the moon moving in splendor, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_27">  <sup>27</sup>so that my heart was secretly enticed <br/>   and my hand offered them a kiss of homage, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_28">  <sup>28</sup>then these also would be sins to be judged, <br/>   for I would have been unfaithful to God on high. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_29">  <sup>29</sup>“If I have rejoiced at my enemy’s misfortune <br/>   or gloated over the trouble that came to him— <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_30">  <sup>30</sup>I have not allowed my mouth to sin <br/>   by invoking a curse against their life— <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_31">  <sup>31</sup>if those of my household have never said, <br/>   ‘Who has not been filled with Job’s meat?’— <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_32">  <sup>32</sup>but no stranger had to spend the night in the street, <br/>   for my door was always open to the traveler— <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_33">  <sup>33</sup>if I have concealed my sin as people do,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or as Adam did">⚓</a><br/>   by hiding my guilt in my heart <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_34">  <sup>34</sup>because I so feared the crowd <br/>   and so dreaded the contempt of the clans <br/>   that I kept silent and would not go outside— <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_35">  <sup>35</sup>(“Oh, that I had someone to hear me! <br/>   I sign now my defense—let the Almighty answer me; <br/>   let my accuser put his indictment in writing. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_36">  <sup>36</sup>Surely I would wear it on my shoulder, <br/>   I would put it on like a crown. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_37">  <sup>37</sup>I would give him an account of my every step; <br/>   I would present it to him as to a ruler.)— <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_38">  <sup>38</sup>“if my land cries out against me <br/>   and all its furrows are wet with tears, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_39">  <sup>39</sup>if I have devoured its yield without payment <br/>   or broken the spirit of its tenants, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_31_40">  <sup>40</sup>then let briers come up instead of wheat <br/>   and stinkweed instead of barley.” <br/> The words of Job are ended. <br/></span>
