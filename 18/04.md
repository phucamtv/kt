<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>Eliphaz </h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_2">  <sup>2</sup>“If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? <br/>   But who can keep from speaking? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_3">  <sup>3</sup>Think how you have instructed many, <br/>   how you have strengthened feeble hands. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_4">  <sup>4</sup>Your words have supported those who stumbled; <br/>   you have strengthened faltering knees. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_5">  <sup>5</sup>But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged; <br/>   it strikes you, and you are dismayed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_6">  <sup>6</sup>Should not your piety be your confidence <br/>   and your blameless ways your hope? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_7">  <sup>7</sup>“Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? <br/>   Where were the upright ever destroyed? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_8">  <sup>8</sup>As I have observed, those who plow evil <br/>   and those who sow trouble reap it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_9">  <sup>9</sup>At the breath of God they perish; <br/>   at the blast of his anger they are no more. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_10">  <sup>10</sup>The lions may roar and growl, <br/>   yet the teeth of the great lions are broken. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_11">  <sup>11</sup>The lion perishes for lack of prey, <br/>   and the cubs of the lioness are scattered. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_12">  <sup>12</sup>“A word was secretly brought to me, <br/>   my ears caught a whisper of it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_13">  <sup>13</sup>Amid disquieting dreams in the night, <br/>   when deep sleep falls on people, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_14">  <sup>14</sup>fear and trembling seized me <br/>   and made all my bones shake. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_15">  <sup>15</sup>A spirit glided past my face, <br/>   and the hair on my body stood on end. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_16">  <sup>16</sup>It stopped, <br/>   but I could not tell what it was. <br/>  A form stood before my eyes, <br/>   and I heard a hushed voice: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_17">  <sup>17</sup>‘Can a mortal be more righteous than God? <br/>   Can even a strong man be more pure than his Maker? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_18">  <sup>18</sup>If God places no trust in his servants, <br/>   if he charges his angels with error, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_19">  <sup>19</sup>how much more those who live in houses of clay, <br/>   whose foundations are in the dust, <br/>   who are crushed more readily than a moth! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_20">  <sup>20</sup>Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces; <br/>   unnoticed, they perish forever. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_4_21">  <sup>21</sup>Are not the cords of their tent pulled up, <br/>   so that they die without wisdom?’ <br/><br/></span>
