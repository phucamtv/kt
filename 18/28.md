<div class="title"><h1>28</h1><h3>Interlude: Where Wisdom Is Found </h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_28_1">  <sup>1</sup>There is a mine for silver <br/>   and a place where gold is refined. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_2">  <sup>2</sup>Iron is taken from the earth, <br/>   and copper is smelted from ore. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_3">  <sup>3</sup>Mortals put an end to the darkness; <br/>   they search out the farthest recesses <br/>   for ore in the blackest darkness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_4">  <sup>4</sup>Far from human dwellings they cut a shaft, <br/>   in places untouched by human feet; <br/>   far from other people they dangle and sway. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_5">  <sup>5</sup>The earth, from which food comes, <br/>   is transformed below as by fire; <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_6">  <sup>6</sup>lapis lazuli comes from its rocks, <br/>   and its dust contains nuggets of gold. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_7">  <sup>7</sup>No bird of prey knows that hidden path, <br/>   no falcon’s eye has seen it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_8">  <sup>8</sup>Proud beasts do not set foot on it, <br/>   and no lion prowls there. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_9">  <sup>9</sup>People assault the flinty rock with their hands <br/>   and lay bare the roots of the mountains. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_10">  <sup>10</sup>They tunnel through the rock; <br/>   their eyes see all its treasures. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_11">  <sup>11</sup>They search<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint, Aquila and Vulgate; Hebrew They dam up">⚓</a> the sources of the rivers <br/>   and bring hidden things to light. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_12">  <sup>12</sup>But where can wisdom be found? <br/>   Where does understanding dwell? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_13">  <sup>13</sup>No mortal comprehends its worth; <br/>   it cannot be found in the land of the living. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_14">  <sup>14</sup>The deep says, “It is not in me”; <br/>   the sea says, “It is not with me.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_15">  <sup>15</sup>It cannot be bought with the finest gold, <br/>   nor can its price be weighed out in silver. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_16">  <sup>16</sup>It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir, <br/>   with precious onyx or lapis lazuli. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_17">  <sup>17</sup>Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it, <br/>   nor can it be had for jewels of gold. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_18">  <sup>18</sup>Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention; <br/>   the price of wisdom is beyond rubies. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_19">  <sup>19</sup>The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it; <br/>   it cannot be bought with pure gold. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_20">  <sup>20</sup>Where then does wisdom come from? <br/>   Where does understanding dwell? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_21">  <sup>21</sup>It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing, <br/>   concealed even from the birds in the sky. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_22">  <sup>22</sup>Destruction<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew Abaddon">⚓</a> and Death say, <br/>   “Only a rumor of it has reached our ears.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_23">  <sup>23</sup>God understands the way to it <br/>   and he alone knows where it dwells, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_24">  <sup>24</sup>for he views the ends of the earth <br/>   and sees everything under the heavens. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_25">  <sup>25</sup>When he established the force of the wind <br/>   and measured out the waters, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_26">  <sup>26</sup>when he made a decree for the rain <br/>   and a path for the thunderstorm, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_27">  <sup>27</sup>then he looked at wisdom and appraised it; <br/>   he confirmed it and tested it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_28_28">  <sup>28</sup>And he said to the human race, <br/>   “The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom, <br/>   and to shun evil is understanding.” <br/></span>
