<span class="verse giop_23_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Job replied: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_2">  <sup>2</sup>“Even today my complaint is bitter; <br/>   his hand<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint and Syriac; Hebrew the hand on me">⚓</a> is heavy in spite of<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or heavy on me in">⚓</a> my groaning. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_3">  <sup>3</sup>If only I knew where to find him; <br/>   if only I could go to his dwelling! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_4">  <sup>4</sup>I would state my case before him <br/>   and fill my mouth with arguments. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_5">  <sup>5</sup>I would find out what he would answer me, <br/>   and consider what he would say to me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_6">  <sup>6</sup>Would he vigorously oppose me? <br/>   No, he would not press charges against me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_7">  <sup>7</sup>There the upright can establish their innocence before him, <br/>   and there I would be delivered forever from my judge. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_8">  <sup>8</sup>“But if I go to the east, he is not there; <br/>   if I go to the west, I do not find him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_9">  <sup>9</sup>When he is at work in the north, I do not see him; <br/>   when he turns to the south, I catch no glimpse of him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_10">  <sup>10</sup>But he knows the way that I take; <br/>   when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_11">  <sup>11</sup>My feet have closely followed his steps; <br/>   I have kept to his way without turning aside. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_12">  <sup>12</sup>I have not departed from the commands of his lips; <br/>   I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_13">  <sup>13</sup>“But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? <br/>   He does whatever he pleases. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_14">  <sup>14</sup>He carries out his decree against me, <br/>   and many such plans he still has in store. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_15">  <sup>15</sup>That is why I am terrified before him; <br/>   when I think of all this, I fear him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_16">  <sup>16</sup>God has made my heart faint; <br/>   the Almighty has terrified me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_17">  <sup>17</sup>Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, <br/>   by the thick darkness that covers my face. <br/><br/></span>
