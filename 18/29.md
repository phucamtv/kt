<div class="title"><h1>29</h1><h3>Job’s Final Defense </h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_29_1"> <sup>1</sup>Job continued his discourse: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_2">  <sup>2</sup>“How I long for the months gone by, <br/>   for the days when God watched over me, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_3">  <sup>3</sup>when his lamp shone on my head <br/>   and by his light I walked through darkness! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_4">  <sup>4</sup>Oh, for the days when I was in my prime, <br/>   when God’s intimate friendship blessed my house, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_5">  <sup>5</sup>when the Almighty was still with me <br/>   and my children were around me, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_6">  <sup>6</sup>when my path was drenched with cream <br/>   and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_7">  <sup>7</sup>“When I went to the gate of the city <br/>   and took my seat in the public square, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_8">  <sup>8</sup>the young men saw me and stepped aside <br/>   and the old men rose to their feet; <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_9">  <sup>9</sup>the chief men refrained from speaking <br/>   and covered their mouths with their hands; <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_10">  <sup>10</sup>the voices of the nobles were hushed, <br/>   and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_11">  <sup>11</sup>Whoever heard me spoke well of me, <br/>   and those who saw me commended me, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_12">  <sup>12</sup>because I rescued the poor who cried for help, <br/>   and the fatherless who had none to assist them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_13">  <sup>13</sup>The one who was dying blessed me; <br/>   I made the widow’s heart sing. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_14">  <sup>14</sup>I put on righteousness as my clothing; <br/>   justice was my robe and my turban. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_15">  <sup>15</sup>I was eyes to the blind <br/>   and feet to the lame. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_16">  <sup>16</sup>I was a father to the needy; <br/>   I took up the case of the stranger. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_17">  <sup>17</sup>I broke the fangs of the wicked <br/>   and snatched the victims from their teeth. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_18">  <sup>18</sup>“I thought, ‘I will die in my own house, <br/>   my days as numerous as the grains of sand. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_19">  <sup>19</sup>My roots will reach to the water, <br/>   and the dew will lie all night on my branches. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_20">  <sup>20</sup>My glory will not fade; <br/>   the bow will be ever new in my hand.’ <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_21">  <sup>21</sup>“People listened to me expectantly, <br/>   waiting in silence for my counsel. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_22">  <sup>22</sup>After I had spoken, they spoke no more; <br/>   my words fell gently on their ears. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_23">  <sup>23</sup>They waited for me as for showers <br/>   and drank in my words as the spring rain. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_24">  <sup>24</sup>When I smiled at them, they scarcely believed it; <br/>   the light of my face was precious to them.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this clause is uncertain.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_29_25">  <sup>25</sup>I chose the way for them and sat as their chief; <br/>   I dwelt as a king among his troops; <br/>   I was like one who comforts mourners. <br/><br/></span>
