<span class="verse giop_35_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Elihu said: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_35_2">  <sup>2</sup>“Do you think this is just? <br/>   You say, ‘I am in the right, not God.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_35_3">  <sup>3</sup>Yet you ask him, ‘What profit is it to me,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or you">⚓</a><br/>   and what do I gain by not sinning?’ <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_35_4">  <sup>4</sup>“I would like to reply to you <br/>   and to your friends with you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_35_5">  <sup>5</sup>Look up at the heavens and see; <br/>   gaze at the clouds so high above you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_35_6">  <sup>6</sup>If you sin, how does that affect him? <br/>   If your sins are many, what does that do to him? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_35_7">  <sup>7</sup>If you are righteous, what do you give to him, <br/>   or what does he receive from your hand? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_35_8">  <sup>8</sup>Your wickedness only affects humans like yourself, <br/>   and your righteousness only other people. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_35_9">  <sup>9</sup>“People cry out under a load of oppression; <br/>   they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_35_10">  <sup>10</sup>But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker, <br/>   who gives songs in the night, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_35_11">  <sup>11</sup>who teaches us more than he teaches<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or night, / 11who teaches us by">⚓</a> the beasts of the earth <br/>   and makes us wiser than<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or us wise by">⚓</a> the birds in the sky?’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_35_12">  <sup>12</sup>He does not answer when people cry out <br/>   because of the arrogance of the wicked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_35_13">  <sup>13</sup>Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea; <br/>   the Almighty pays no attention to it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_35_14">  <sup>14</sup>How much less, then, will he listen <br/>   when you say that you do not see him, <br/>  that your case is before him <br/>   and you must wait for him, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_35_15">  <sup>15</sup>and further, that his anger never punishes <br/>   and he does not take the least notice of wickedness.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Symmachus, Theodotion and Vulgate; the meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_35_16">  <sup>16</sup>So Job opens his mouth with empty talk; <br/>   without knowledge he multiplies words.” <br/></span>
