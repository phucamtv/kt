<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>Job Speaks </h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. </span>
<span class="verse giop_3_2"><sup>2</sup>He said: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_3">  <sup>3</sup>“May the day of my birth perish, <br/>   and the night that said, ‘A boy is conceived!’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_4">  <sup>4</sup>That day—may it turn to darkness; <br/>   may God above not care about it; <br/>   may no light shine on it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_5">  <sup>5</sup>May gloom and utter darkness claim it once more; <br/>   may a cloud settle over it; <br/>   may blackness overwhelm it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_6">  <sup>6</sup>That night—may thick darkness seize it; <br/>   may it not be included among the days of the year <br/>   nor be entered in any of the months. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_7">  <sup>7</sup>May that night be barren; <br/>   may no shout of joy be heard in it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_8">  <sup>8</sup>May those who curse days<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or curse the sea">⚓</a> curse that day, <br/>   those who are ready to rouse Leviathan. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_9">  <sup>9</sup>May its morning stars become dark; <br/>   may it wait for daylight in vain <br/>   and not see the first rays of dawn, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_10">  <sup>10</sup>for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me <br/>   to hide trouble from my eyes. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_11">  <sup>11</sup>“Why did I not perish at birth, <br/>   and die as I came from the womb? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_12">  <sup>12</sup>Why were there knees to receive me <br/>   and breasts that I might be nursed? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_13">  <sup>13</sup>For now I would be lying down in peace; <br/>   I would be asleep and at rest <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_14">  <sup>14</sup>with kings and rulers of the earth, <br/>   who built for themselves places now lying in ruins, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_15">  <sup>15</sup>with princes who had gold, <br/>   who filled their houses with silver. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_16">  <sup>16</sup>Or why was I not hidden away in the ground like a stillborn child, <br/>   like an infant who never saw the light of day? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_17">  <sup>17</sup>There the wicked cease from turmoil, <br/>   and there the weary are at rest. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_18">  <sup>18</sup>Captives also enjoy their ease; <br/>   they no longer hear the slave driver’s shout. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_19">  <sup>19</sup>The small and the great are there, <br/>   and the slaves are freed from their owners. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_20">  <sup>20</sup>“Why is light given to those in misery, <br/>   and life to the bitter of soul, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_21">  <sup>21</sup>to those who long for death that does not come, <br/>   who search for it more than for hidden treasure, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_22">  <sup>22</sup>who are filled with gladness <br/>   and rejoice when they reach the grave? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_23">  <sup>23</sup>Why is life given to a man <br/>   whose way is hidden, <br/>   whom God has hedged in? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_24">  <sup>24</sup>For sighing has become my daily food; <br/>   my groans pour out like water. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_25">  <sup>25</sup>What I feared has come upon me; <br/>   what I dreaded has happened to me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_3_26">  <sup>26</sup>I have no peace, no quietness; <br/>   I have no rest, but only turmoil.” <br/></span>
