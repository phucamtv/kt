<div class="title"><h1>18</h1><h3>Bildad </h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_18_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Bildad the Shuhite replied: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_2">  <sup>2</sup>“When will you end these speeches? <br/>   Be sensible, and then we can talk. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_3">  <sup>3</sup>Why are we regarded as cattle <br/>   and considered stupid in your sight? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_4">  <sup>4</sup>You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger, <br/>   is the earth to be abandoned for your sake? <br/>   Or must the rocks be moved from their place? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_5">  <sup>5</sup>“The lamp of a wicked man is snuffed out; <br/>   the flame of his fire stops burning. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_6">  <sup>6</sup>The light in his tent becomes dark; <br/>   the lamp beside him goes out. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_7">  <sup>7</sup>The vigor of his step is weakened; <br/>   his own schemes throw him down. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_8">  <sup>8</sup>His feet thrust him into a net; <br/>   he wanders into its mesh. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_9">  <sup>9</sup>A trap seizes him by the heel; <br/>   a snare holds him fast. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_10">  <sup>10</sup>A noose is hidden for him on the ground; <br/>   a trap lies in his path. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_11">  <sup>11</sup>Terrors startle him on every side <br/>   and dog his every step. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_12">  <sup>12</sup>Calamity is hungry for him; <br/>   disaster is ready for him when he falls. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_13">  <sup>13</sup>It eats away parts of his skin; <br/>   death’s firstborn devours his limbs. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_14">  <sup>14</sup>He is torn from the security of his tent <br/>   and marched off to the king of terrors. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_15">  <sup>15</sup>Fire resides<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Nothing he had remains">⚓</a> in his tent; <br/>   burning sulfur is scattered over his dwelling. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_16">  <sup>16</sup>His roots dry up below <br/>   and his branches wither above. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_17">  <sup>17</sup>The memory of him perishes from the earth; <br/>   he has no name in the land. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_18">  <sup>18</sup>He is driven from light into the realm of darkness <br/>   and is banished from the world. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_19">  <sup>19</sup>He has no offspring or descendants among his people, <br/>   no survivor where once he lived. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_20">  <sup>20</sup>People of the west are appalled at his fate; <br/>   those of the east are seized with horror. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_21">  <sup>21</sup>Surely such is the dwelling of an evil man; <br/>   such is the place of one who does not know God.” <br/></span>
