<div class="title"><h1>22</h1><h3>Eliphaz </h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_22_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_2">  <sup>2</sup>“Can a man be of benefit to God? <br/>   Can even a wise person benefit him? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_3">  <sup>3</sup>What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous? <br/>   What would he gain if your ways were blameless? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_4">  <sup>4</sup>“Is it for your piety that he rebukes you <br/>   and brings charges against you? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_5">  <sup>5</sup>Is not your wickedness great? <br/>   Are not your sins endless? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_6">  <sup>6</sup>You demanded security from your relatives for no reason; <br/>   you stripped people of their clothing, leaving them naked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_7">  <sup>7</sup>You gave no water to the weary <br/>   and you withheld food from the hungry, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_8">  <sup>8</sup>though you were a powerful man, owning land— <br/>   an honored man, living on it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_9">  <sup>9</sup>And you sent widows away empty-handed <br/>   and broke the strength of the fatherless. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_10">  <sup>10</sup>That is why snares are all around you, <br/>   why sudden peril terrifies you, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_11">  <sup>11</sup>why it is so dark you cannot see, <br/>   and why a flood of water covers you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_12">  <sup>12</sup>“Is not God in the heights of heaven? <br/>   And see how lofty are the highest stars! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_13">  <sup>13</sup>Yet you say, ‘What does God know? <br/>   Does he judge through such darkness? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_14">  <sup>14</sup>Thick clouds veil him, so he does not see us <br/>   as he goes about in the vaulted heavens.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_15">  <sup>15</sup>Will you keep to the old path <br/>   that the wicked have trod? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_16">  <sup>16</sup>They were carried off before their time, <br/>   their foundations washed away by a flood. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_17">  <sup>17</sup>They said to God, ‘Leave us alone! <br/>   What can the Almighty do to us?’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_18">  <sup>18</sup>Yet it was he who filled their houses with good things, <br/>   so I stand aloof from the plans of the wicked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_19">  <sup>19</sup>The righteous see their ruin and rejoice; <br/>   the innocent mock them, saying, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_20">  <sup>20</sup>‘Surely our foes are destroyed, <br/>   and fire devours their wealth.’ <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_21">  <sup>21</sup>“Submit to God and be at peace with him; <br/>   in this way prosperity will come to you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_22">  <sup>22</sup>Accept instruction from his mouth <br/>   and lay up his words in your heart. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_23">  <sup>23</sup>If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored: <br/>   If you remove wickedness far from your tent <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_24">  <sup>24</sup>and assign your nuggets to the dust, <br/>   your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the ravines, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_25">  <sup>25</sup>then the Almighty will be your gold, <br/>   the choicest silver for you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_26">  <sup>26</sup>Surely then you will find delight in the Almighty <br/>   and will lift up your face to God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_27">  <sup>27</sup>You will pray to him, and he will hear you, <br/>   and you will fulfill your vows. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_28">  <sup>28</sup>What you decide on will be done, <br/>   and light will shine on your ways. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_29">  <sup>29</sup>When people are brought low and you say, ‘Lift them up!’ <br/>   then he will save the downcast. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_22_30">  <sup>30</sup>He will deliver even one who is not innocent, <br/>   who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.” <br/></span>
