<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>Zophar </h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Zophar the Naamathite replied: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_11_2">  <sup>2</sup>“Are all these words to go unanswered? <br/>   Is this talker to be vindicated? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_11_3">  <sup>3</sup>Will your idle talk reduce others to silence? <br/>   Will no one rebuke you when you mock? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_11_4">  <sup>4</sup>You say to God, ‘My beliefs are flawless <br/>   and I am pure in your sight.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_11_5">  <sup>5</sup>Oh, how I wish that God would speak, <br/>   that he would open his lips against you <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_11_6">  <sup>6</sup>and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, <br/>   for true wisdom has two sides. <br/>   Know this: God has even forgotten some of your sin. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_11_7">  <sup>7</sup>“Can you fathom the mysteries of God? <br/>   Can you probe the limits of the Almighty? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_11_8">  <sup>8</sup>They are higher than the heavens above—what can you do? <br/>   They are deeper than the depths below—what can you know? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_11_9">  <sup>9</sup>Their measure is longer than the earth <br/>   and wider than the sea. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_11_10">  <sup>10</sup>“If he comes along and confines you in prison <br/>   and convenes a court, who can oppose him? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_11_11">  <sup>11</sup>Surely he recognizes deceivers; <br/>   and when he sees evil, does he not take note? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_11_12">  <sup>12</sup>But the witless can no more become wise <br/>   than a wild donkey’s colt can be born human.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or wild donkey can be born tame">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_11_13">  <sup>13</sup>“Yet if you devote your heart to him <br/>   and stretch out your hands to him, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_11_14">  <sup>14</sup>if you put away the sin that is in your hand <br/>   and allow no evil to dwell in your tent, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_11_15">  <sup>15</sup>then, free of fault, you will lift up your face; <br/>   you will stand firm and without fear. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_11_16">  <sup>16</sup>You will surely forget your trouble, <br/>   recalling it only as waters gone by. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_11_17">  <sup>17</sup>Life will be brighter than noonday, <br/>   and darkness will become like morning. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_11_18">  <sup>18</sup>You will be secure, because there is hope; <br/>   you will look about you and take your rest in safety. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_11_19">  <sup>19</sup>You will lie down, with no one to make you afraid, <br/>   and many will court your favor. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_11_20">  <sup>20</sup>But the eyes of the wicked will fail, <br/>   and escape will elude them; <br/>   their hope will become a dying gasp.” <br/></span>
