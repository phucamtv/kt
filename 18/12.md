<span class="verse giop_12_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Job replied: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_2">  <sup>2</sup>“Doubtless you are the only people who matter, <br/>   and wisdom will die with you! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_3">  <sup>3</sup>But I have a mind as well as you; <br/>   I am not inferior to you. <br/>   Who does not know all these things? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_4">  <sup>4</sup>“I have become a laughingstock to my friends, <br/>   though I called on God and he answered— <br/>   a mere laughingstock, though righteous and blameless! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_5">  <sup>5</sup>Those who are at ease have contempt for misfortune <br/>   as the fate of those whose feet are slipping. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_6">  <sup>6</sup>The tents of marauders are undisturbed, <br/>   and those who provoke God are secure— <br/>   those God has in his hand.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or those whose god is in their own hand">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_7">  <sup>7</sup>“But ask the animals, and they will teach you, <br/>   or the birds in the sky, and they will tell you; <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_8">  <sup>8</sup>or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, <br/>   or let the fish in the sea inform you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_9">  <sup>9</sup>Which of all these does not know <br/>   that the hand of the Lord has done this? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_10">  <sup>10</sup>In his hand is the life of every creature <br/>   and the breath of all mankind. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_11">  <sup>11</sup>Does not the ear test words <br/>   as the tongue tastes food? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_12">  <sup>12</sup>Is not wisdom found among the aged? <br/>   Does not long life bring understanding? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_13">  <sup>13</sup>“To God belong wisdom and power; <br/>   counsel and understanding are his. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_14">  <sup>14</sup>What he tears down cannot be rebuilt; <br/>   those he imprisons cannot be released. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_15">  <sup>15</sup>If he holds back the waters, there is drought; <br/>   if he lets them loose, they devastate the land. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_16">  <sup>16</sup>To him belong strength and insight; <br/>   both deceived and deceiver are his. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_17">  <sup>17</sup>He leads rulers away stripped <br/>   and makes fools of judges. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_18">  <sup>18</sup>He takes off the shackles put on by kings <br/>   and ties a loincloth<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or shackles of kings / and ties a belt">⚓</a> around their waist. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_19">  <sup>19</sup>He leads priests away stripped <br/>   and overthrows officials long established. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_20">  <sup>20</sup>He silences the lips of trusted advisers <br/>   and takes away the discernment of elders. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_21">  <sup>21</sup>He pours contempt on nobles <br/>   and disarms the mighty. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_22">  <sup>22</sup>He reveals the deep things of darkness <br/>   and brings utter darkness into the light. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_23">  <sup>23</sup>He makes nations great, and destroys them; <br/>   he enlarges nations, and disperses them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_24">  <sup>24</sup>He deprives the leaders of the earth of their reason; <br/>   he makes them wander in a trackless waste. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_12_25">  <sup>25</sup>They grope in darkness with no light; <br/>   he makes them stagger like drunkards. <br/><br/></span>
