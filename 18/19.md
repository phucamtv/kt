<span class="verse giop_19_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Job replied: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_2">  <sup>2</sup>“How long will you torment me <br/>   and crush me with words? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_3">  <sup>3</sup>Ten times now you have reproached me; <br/>   shamelessly you attack me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_4">  <sup>4</sup>If it is true that I have gone astray, <br/>   my error remains my concern alone. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_5">  <sup>5</sup>If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me <br/>   and use my humiliation against me, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_6">  <sup>6</sup>then know that God has wronged me <br/>   and drawn his net around me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_7">  <sup>7</sup>“Though I cry, ‘Violence!’ I get no response; <br/>   though I call for help, there is no justice. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_8">  <sup>8</sup>He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; <br/>   he has shrouded my paths in darkness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_9">  <sup>9</sup>He has stripped me of my honor <br/>   and removed the crown from my head. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_10">  <sup>10</sup>He tears me down on every side till I am gone; <br/>   he uproots my hope like a tree. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_11">  <sup>11</sup>His anger burns against me; <br/>   he counts me among his enemies. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_12">  <sup>12</sup>His troops advance in force; <br/>   they build a siege ramp against me <br/>   and encamp around my tent. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_13">  <sup>13</sup>“He has alienated my family from me; <br/>   my acquaintances are completely estranged from me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_14">  <sup>14</sup>My relatives have gone away; <br/>   my closest friends have forgotten me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_15">  <sup>15</sup>My guests and my female servants count me a foreigner; <br/>   they look on me as on a stranger. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_16">  <sup>16</sup>I summon my servant, but he does not answer, <br/>   though I beg him with my own mouth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_17">  <sup>17</sup>My breath is offensive to my wife; <br/>   I am loathsome to my own family. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_18">  <sup>18</sup>Even the little boys scorn me; <br/>   when I appear, they ridicule me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_19">  <sup>19</sup>All my intimate friends detest me; <br/>   those I love have turned against me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_20">  <sup>20</sup>I am nothing but skin and bones; <br/>   I have escaped only by the skin of my teeth.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or only by my gums">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_21">  <sup>21</sup>“Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, <br/>   for the hand of God has struck me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_22">  <sup>22</sup>Why do you pursue me as God does? <br/>   Will you never get enough of my flesh? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_23">  <sup>23</sup>“Oh, that my words were recorded, <br/>   that they were written on a scroll, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_24">  <sup>24</sup>that they were inscribed with an iron tool on<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or and">⚓</a> lead, <br/>   or engraved in rock forever! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_25">  <sup>25</sup>I know that my redeemer<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or vindicator">⚓</a> lives, <br/>   and that in the end he will stand on the earth.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or on my grave">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_26">  <sup>26</sup>And after my skin has been destroyed, <br/>   yet<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or And after I awake, / though this body has been destroyed, / then">⚓</a> in<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or destroyed, / apart from">⚓</a> my flesh I will see God; <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_27">  <sup>27</sup>I myself will see him <br/>   with my own eyes—I, and not another. <br/>   How my heart yearns within me! <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_28">  <sup>28</sup>“If you say, ‘How we will hound him, <br/>   since the root of the trouble lies in him,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Many Hebrew manuscripts, Septuagint and Vulgate; most Hebrew manuscripts me">⚓</a> ’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_29">  <sup>29</sup>you should fear the sword yourselves; <br/>   for wrath will bring punishment by the sword, <br/>   and then you will know that there is judgment.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or sword, / that you may come to know the Almighty">⚓</a> ” <br/></span>
