<div class="title"><h1>39</h1></div>
<span class="verse giop_39_1">  <sup>1</sup>“Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? <br/>   Do you watch when the doe bears her fawn? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_2">  <sup>2</sup>Do you count the months till they bear? <br/>   Do you know the time they give birth? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_3">  <sup>3</sup>They crouch down and bring forth their young; <br/>   their labor pains are ended. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_4">  <sup>4</sup>Their young thrive and grow strong in the wilds; <br/>   they leave and do not return. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_5">  <sup>5</sup>“Who let the wild donkey go free? <br/>   Who untied its ropes? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_6">  <sup>6</sup>I gave it the wasteland as its home, <br/>   the salt flats as its habitat. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_7">  <sup>7</sup>It laughs at the commotion in the town; <br/>   it does not hear a driver’s shout. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_8">  <sup>8</sup>It ranges the hills for its pasture <br/>   and searches for any green thing. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_9">  <sup>9</sup>“Will the wild ox consent to serve you? <br/>   Will it stay by your manger at night? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_10">  <sup>10</sup>Can you hold it to the furrow with a harness? <br/>   Will it till the valleys behind you? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_11">  <sup>11</sup>Will you rely on it for its great strength? <br/>   Will you leave your heavy work to it? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_12">  <sup>12</sup>Can you trust it to haul in your grain <br/>   and bring it to your threshing floor? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_13">  <sup>13</sup>“The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, <br/>   though they cannot compare <br/>   with the wings and feathers of the stork. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_14">  <sup>14</sup>She lays her eggs on the ground <br/>   and lets them warm in the sand, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_15">  <sup>15</sup>unmindful that a foot may crush them, <br/>   that some wild animal may trample them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_16">  <sup>16</sup>She treats her young harshly, as if they were not hers; <br/>   she cares not that her labor was in vain, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_17">  <sup>17</sup>for God did not endow her with wisdom <br/>   or give her a share of good sense. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_18">  <sup>18</sup>Yet when she spreads her feathers to run, <br/>   she laughs at horse and rider. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_19">  <sup>19</sup>“Do you give the horse its strength <br/>   or clothe its neck with a flowing mane? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_20">  <sup>20</sup>Do you make it leap like a locust, <br/>   striking terror with its proud snorting? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_21">  <sup>21</sup>It paws fiercely, rejoicing in its strength, <br/>   and charges into the fray. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_22">  <sup>22</sup>It laughs at fear, afraid of nothing; <br/>   it does not shy away from the sword. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_23">  <sup>23</sup>The quiver rattles against its side, <br/>   along with the flashing spear and lance. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_24">  <sup>24</sup>In frenzied excitement it eats up the ground; <br/>   it cannot stand still when the trumpet sounds. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_25">  <sup>25</sup>At the blast of the trumpet it snorts, ‘Aha!’ <br/>   It catches the scent of battle from afar, <br/>   the shout of commanders and the battle cry. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_26">  <sup>26</sup>“Does the hawk take flight by your wisdom <br/>   and spread its wings toward the south? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_27">  <sup>27</sup>Does the eagle soar at your command <br/>   and build its nest on high? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_28">  <sup>28</sup>It dwells on a cliff and stays there at night; <br/>   a rocky crag is its stronghold. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_29">  <sup>29</sup>From there it looks for food; <br/>   its eyes detect it from afar. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_39_30">  <sup>30</sup>Its young ones feast on blood, <br/>   and where the slain are, there it is.” <br/></span>
