<span class="verse giop_33_1">  <sup>1</sup>“But now, Job, listen to my words; <br/>   pay attention to everything I say. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_2">  <sup>2</sup>I am about to open my mouth; <br/>   my words are on the tip of my tongue. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_3">  <sup>3</sup>My words come from an upright heart; <br/>   my lips sincerely speak what I know. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_4">  <sup>4</sup>The Spirit of God has made me; <br/>   the breath of the Almighty gives me life. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_5">  <sup>5</sup>Answer me then, if you can; <br/>   stand up and argue your case before me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_6">  <sup>6</sup>I am the same as you in God’s sight; <br/>   I too am a piece of clay. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_7">  <sup>7</sup>No fear of me should alarm you, <br/>   nor should my hand be heavy on you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_8">  <sup>8</sup>“But you have said in my hearing— <br/>   I heard the very words— <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_9">  <sup>9</sup>‘I am pure, I have done no wrong; <br/>   I am clean and free from sin. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_10">  <sup>10</sup>Yet God has found fault with me; <br/>   he considers me his enemy. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_11">  <sup>11</sup>He fastens my feet in shackles; <br/>   he keeps close watch on all my paths.’ <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_12">  <sup>12</sup>“But I tell you, in this you are not right, <br/>   for God is greater than any mortal. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_13">  <sup>13</sup>Why do you complain to him <br/>   that he responds to no one’s words<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or that he does not answer for any of his actions">⚓</a> ? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_14">  <sup>14</sup>For God does speak—now one way, now another— <br/>   though no one perceives it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_15">  <sup>15</sup>In a dream, in a vision of the night, <br/>   when deep sleep falls on people <br/>   as they slumber in their beds, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_16">  <sup>16</sup>he may speak in their ears <br/>   and terrify them with warnings, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_17">  <sup>17</sup>to turn them from wrongdoing <br/>   and keep them from pride, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_18">  <sup>18</sup>to preserve them from the pit, <br/>   their lives from perishing by the sword.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or from crossing the river">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_19">  <sup>19</sup>“Or someone may be chastened on a bed of pain <br/>   with constant distress in their bones, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_20">  <sup>20</sup>so that their body finds food repulsive <br/>   and their soul loathes the choicest meal. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_21">  <sup>21</sup>Their flesh wastes away to nothing, <br/>   and their bones, once hidden, now stick out. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_22">  <sup>22</sup>They draw near to the pit, <br/>   and their life to the messengers of death.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or to the place of the dead">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_23">  <sup>23</sup>Yet if there is an angel at their side, <br/>   a messenger, one out of a thousand, <br/>   sent to tell them how to be upright, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_24">  <sup>24</sup>and he is gracious to that person and says to God, <br/>   ‘Spare them from going down to the pit; <br/>   I have found a ransom for them— <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_25">  <sup>25</sup>let their flesh be renewed like a child’s; <br/>   let them be restored as in the days of their youth’— <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_26">  <sup>26</sup>then that person can pray to God and find favor with him, <br/>   they will see God’s face and shout for joy; <br/>   he will restore them to full well-being. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_27">  <sup>27</sup>And they will go to others and say, <br/>   ‘I have sinned, I have perverted what is right, <br/>   but I did not get what I deserved. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_28">  <sup>28</sup>God has delivered me from going down to the pit, <br/>   and I shall live to enjoy the light of life.’ <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_29">  <sup>29</sup>“God does all these things to a person— <br/>   twice, even three times— <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_30">  <sup>30</sup>to turn them back from the pit, <br/>   that the light of life may shine on them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_31">  <sup>31</sup>“Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; <br/>   be silent, and I will speak. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_32">  <sup>32</sup>If you have anything to say, answer me; <br/>   speak up, for I want to vindicate you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_33_33">  <sup>33</sup>But if not, then listen to me; <br/>   be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.” <br/></span>
