<div class="title"><h1>32</h1><h3>Elihu </h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_32_1"> <sup>1</sup>So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. </span>
<span class="verse giop_32_2"><sup>2</sup>But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God. </span>
<span class="verse giop_32_3"><sup>3</sup>He was also angry with the three friends, because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Masoretic Text; an ancient Hebrew scribal tradition Job, and so had condemned God">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_4"><sup>4</sup>Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he. </span>
<span class="verse giop_32_5"><sup>5</sup>But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger was aroused. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_6"> <sup>6</sup>So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said: <br/>  “I am young in years, <br/>   and you are old; <br/>  that is why I was fearful, <br/>   not daring to tell you what I know. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_7">  <sup>7</sup>I thought, ‘Age should speak; <br/>   advanced years should teach wisdom.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_8">  <sup>8</sup>But it is the spirit<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Spirit ; also in verse 18">⚓</a> in a person, <br/>   the breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_9">  <sup>9</sup>It is not only the old<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or many ; or great">⚓</a> who are wise, <br/>   not only the aged who understand what is right. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_10">  <sup>10</sup>“Therefore I say: Listen to me; <br/>   I too will tell you what I know. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_11">  <sup>11</sup>I waited while you spoke, <br/>   I listened to your reasoning; <br/>  while you were searching for words, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_12">   <sup>12</sup>I gave you my full attention. <br/>  But not one of you has proved Job wrong; <br/>   none of you has answered his arguments. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_13">  <sup>13</sup>Do not say, ‘We have found wisdom; <br/>   let God, not a man, refute him.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_14">  <sup>14</sup>But Job has not marshaled his words against me, <br/>   and I will not answer him with your arguments. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_15">  <sup>15</sup>“They are dismayed and have no more to say; <br/>   words have failed them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_16">  <sup>16</sup>Must I wait, now that they are silent, <br/>   now that they stand there with no reply? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_17">  <sup>17</sup>I too will have my say; <br/>   I too will tell what I know. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_18">  <sup>18</sup>For I am full of words, <br/>   and the spirit within me compels me; <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_19">  <sup>19</sup>inside I am like bottled-up wine, <br/>   like new wineskins ready to burst. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_20">  <sup>20</sup>I must speak and find relief; <br/>   I must open my lips and reply. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_21">  <sup>21</sup>I will show no partiality, <br/>   nor will I flatter anyone; <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_22">  <sup>22</sup>for if I were skilled in flattery, <br/>   my Maker would soon take me away. <br/><br/></span>
