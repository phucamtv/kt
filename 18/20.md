<div class="title"><h1>20</h1><h3>Zophar </h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_20_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Zophar the Naamathite replied: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_2">  <sup>2</sup>“My troubled thoughts prompt me to answer <br/>   because I am greatly disturbed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_3">  <sup>3</sup>I hear a rebuke that dishonors me, <br/>   and my understanding inspires me to reply. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_4">  <sup>4</sup>“Surely you know how it has been from of old, <br/>   ever since mankind<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Adam">⚓</a> was placed on the earth, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_5">  <sup>5</sup>that the mirth of the wicked is brief, <br/>   the joy of the godless lasts but a moment. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_6">  <sup>6</sup>Though the pride of the godless person reaches to the heavens <br/>   and his head touches the clouds, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_7">  <sup>7</sup>he will perish forever, like his own dung; <br/>   those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_8">  <sup>8</sup>Like a dream he flies away, no more to be found, <br/>   banished like a vision of the night. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_9">  <sup>9</sup>The eye that saw him will not see him again; <br/>   his place will look on him no more. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_10">  <sup>10</sup>His children must make amends to the poor; <br/>   his own hands must give back his wealth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_11">  <sup>11</sup>The youthful vigor that fills his bones <br/>   will lie with him in the dust. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_12">  <sup>12</sup>“Though evil is sweet in his mouth <br/>   and he hides it under his tongue, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_13">  <sup>13</sup>though he cannot bear to let it go <br/>   and lets it linger in his mouth, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_14">  <sup>14</sup>yet his food will turn sour in his stomach; <br/>   it will become the venom of serpents within him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_15">  <sup>15</sup>He will spit out the riches he swallowed; <br/>   God will make his stomach vomit them up. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_16">  <sup>16</sup>He will suck the poison of serpents; <br/>   the fangs of an adder will kill him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_17">  <sup>17</sup>He will not enjoy the streams, <br/>   the rivers flowing with honey and cream. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_18">  <sup>18</sup>What he toiled for he must give back uneaten; <br/>   he will not enjoy the profit from his trading. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_19">  <sup>19</sup>For he has oppressed the poor and left them destitute; <br/>   he has seized houses he did not build. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_20">  <sup>20</sup>“Surely he will have no respite from his craving; <br/>   he cannot save himself by his treasure. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_21">  <sup>21</sup>Nothing is left for him to devour; <br/>   his prosperity will not endure. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_22">  <sup>22</sup>In the midst of his plenty, distress will overtake him; <br/>   the full force of misery will come upon him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_23">  <sup>23</sup>When he has filled his belly, <br/>   God will vent his burning anger against him <br/>   and rain down his blows on him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_24">  <sup>24</sup>Though he flees from an iron weapon, <br/>   a bronze-tipped arrow pierces him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_25">  <sup>25</sup>He pulls it out of his back, <br/>   the gleaming point out of his liver. <br/>  Terrors will come over him; <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_26">   <sup>26</sup>total darkness lies in wait for his treasures. <br/>  A fire unfanned will consume him <br/>   and devour what is left in his tent. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_27">  <sup>27</sup>The heavens will expose his guilt; <br/>   the earth will rise up against him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_28">  <sup>28</sup>A flood will carry off his house, <br/>   rushing waters<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or The possessions in his house will be carried off, / washed away">⚓</a> on the day of God’s wrath. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_29">  <sup>29</sup>Such is the fate God allots the wicked, <br/>   the heritage appointed for them by God.” <br/></span>
