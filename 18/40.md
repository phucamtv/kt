<span class="verse giop_40_1"> <sup>1</sup>The Lord said to Job: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_2">  <sup>2</sup>“Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? <br/>   Let him who accuses God answer him!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then Job answered the Lord: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_4">  <sup>4</sup>“I am unworthy—how can I reply to you? <br/>   I put my hand over my mouth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_5">  <sup>5</sup>I spoke once, but I have no answer— <br/>   twice, but I will say no more.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_7">  <sup>7</sup>“Brace yourself like a man; <br/>   I will question you, <br/>   and you shall answer me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_8">  <sup>8</sup>“Would you discredit my justice? <br/>   Would you condemn me to justify yourself? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_9">  <sup>9</sup>Do you have an arm like God’s, <br/>   and can your voice thunder like his? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_10">  <sup>10</sup>Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor, <br/>   and clothe yourself in honor and majesty. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_11">  <sup>11</sup>Unleash the fury of your wrath, <br/>   look at all who are proud and bring them low, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_12">  <sup>12</sup>look at all who are proud and humble them, <br/>   crush the wicked where they stand. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_13">  <sup>13</sup>Bury them all in the dust together; <br/>   shroud their faces in the grave. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_14">  <sup>14</sup>Then I myself will admit to you <br/>   that your own right hand can save you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_15">  <sup>15</sup>“Look at Behemoth, <br/>   which I made along with you <br/>   and which feeds on grass like an ox. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_16">  <sup>16</sup>What strength it has in its loins, <br/>   what power in the muscles of its belly! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_17">  <sup>17</sup>Its tail sways like a cedar; <br/>   the sinews of its thighs are close-knit. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_18">  <sup>18</sup>Its bones are tubes of bronze, <br/>   its limbs like rods of iron. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_19">  <sup>19</sup>It ranks first among the works of God, <br/>   yet its Maker can approach it with his sword. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_20">  <sup>20</sup>The hills bring it their produce, <br/>   and all the wild animals play nearby. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_21">  <sup>21</sup>Under the lotus plants it lies, <br/>   hidden among the reeds in the marsh. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_22">  <sup>22</sup>The lotuses conceal it in their shadow; <br/>   the poplars by the stream surround it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_23">  <sup>23</sup>A raging river does not alarm it; <br/>   it is secure, though the Jordan should surge against its mouth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_40_24">  <sup>24</sup>Can anyone capture it by the eyes, <br/>   or trap it and pierce its nose? <br/><br/></span>
