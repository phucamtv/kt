<div class="title"><h1>8</h1><h3>Bildad </h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Bildad the Shuhite replied: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_2">  <sup>2</sup>“How long will you say such things? <br/>   Your words are a blustering wind. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_3">  <sup>3</sup>Does God pervert justice? <br/>   Does the Almighty pervert what is right? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_4">  <sup>4</sup>When your children sinned against him, <br/>   he gave them over to the penalty of their sin. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_5">  <sup>5</sup>But if you will seek God earnestly <br/>   and plead with the Almighty, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_6">  <sup>6</sup>if you are pure and upright, <br/>   even now he will rouse himself on your behalf <br/>   and restore you to your prosperous state. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_7">  <sup>7</sup>Your beginnings will seem humble, <br/>   so prosperous will your future be. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_8">  <sup>8</sup>“Ask the former generation <br/>   and find out what their ancestors learned, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_9">  <sup>9</sup>for we were born only yesterday and know nothing, <br/>   and our days on earth are but a shadow. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_10">  <sup>10</sup>Will they not instruct you and tell you? <br/>   Will they not bring forth words from their understanding? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_11">  <sup>11</sup>Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh? <br/>   Can reeds thrive without water? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_12">  <sup>12</sup>While still growing and uncut, <br/>   they wither more quickly than grass. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_13">  <sup>13</sup>Such is the destiny of all who forget God; <br/>   so perishes the hope of the godless. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_14">  <sup>14</sup>What they trust in is fragile<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.">⚓</a> ; <br/>   what they rely on is a spider’s web. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_15">  <sup>15</sup>They lean on the web, but it gives way; <br/>   they cling to it, but it does not hold. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_16">  <sup>16</sup>They are like a well-watered plant in the sunshine, <br/>   spreading its shoots over the garden; <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_17">  <sup>17</sup>it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks <br/>   and looks for a place among the stones. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_18">  <sup>18</sup>But when it is torn from its spot, <br/>   that place disowns it and says, ‘I never saw you.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_19">  <sup>19</sup>Surely its life withers away, <br/>   and<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Surely all the joy it has / is that">⚓</a> from the soil other plants grow. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_20">  <sup>20</sup>“Surely God does not reject one who is blameless <br/>   or strengthen the hands of evildoers. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_21">  <sup>21</sup>He will yet fill your mouth with laughter <br/>   and your lips with shouts of joy. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_8_22">  <sup>22</sup>Your enemies will be clothed in shame, <br/>   and the tents of the wicked will be no more.” <br/></span>
