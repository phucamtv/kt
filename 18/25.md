<div class="title"><h1>25</h1><h3>Bildad </h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_25_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Bildad the Shuhite replied: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_25_2">  <sup>2</sup>“Dominion and awe belong to God; <br/>   he establishes order in the heights of heaven. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_25_3">  <sup>3</sup>Can his forces be numbered? <br/>   On whom does his light not rise? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_25_4">  <sup>4</sup>How then can a mortal be righteous before God? <br/>   How can one born of woman be pure? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_25_5">  <sup>5</sup>If even the moon is not bright <br/>   and the stars are not pure in his eyes, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_25_6">  <sup>6</sup>how much less a mortal, who is but a maggot— <br/>   a human being, who is only a worm!” <br/></span>
