<span class="verse giop_14_1">  <sup>1</sup>“Mortals, born of woman, <br/>   are of few days and full of trouble. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_2">  <sup>2</sup>They spring up like flowers and wither away; <br/>   like fleeting shadows, they do not endure. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_3">  <sup>3</sup>Do you fix your eye on them? <br/>   Will you bring them<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint, Vulgate and Syriac; Hebrew me">⚓</a> before you for judgment? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_4">  <sup>4</sup>Who can bring what is pure from the impure? <br/>   No one! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_5">  <sup>5</sup>A person’s days are determined; <br/>   you have decreed the number of his months <br/>   and have set limits he cannot exceed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_6">  <sup>6</sup>So look away from him and let him alone, <br/>   till he has put in his time like a hired laborer. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_7">  <sup>7</sup>“At least there is hope for a tree: <br/>   If it is cut down, it will sprout again, <br/>   and its new shoots will not fail. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_8">  <sup>8</sup>Its roots may grow old in the ground <br/>   and its stump die in the soil, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_9">  <sup>9</sup>yet at the scent of water it will bud <br/>   and put forth shoots like a plant. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_10">  <sup>10</sup>But a man dies and is laid low; <br/>   he breathes his last and is no more. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_11">  <sup>11</sup>As the water of a lake dries up <br/>   or a riverbed becomes parched and dry, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_12">  <sup>12</sup>so he lies down and does not rise; <br/>   till the heavens are no more, people will not awake <br/>   or be roused from their sleep. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_13">  <sup>13</sup>“If only you would hide me in the grave <br/>   and conceal me till your anger has passed! <br/>  If only you would set me a time <br/>   and then remember me! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_14">  <sup>14</sup>If someone dies, will they live again? <br/>   All the days of my hard service <br/>   I will wait for my renewal<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or release">⚓</a> to come. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_15">  <sup>15</sup>You will call and I will answer you; <br/>   you will long for the creature your hands have made. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_16">  <sup>16</sup>Surely then you will count my steps <br/>   but not keep track of my sin. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_17">  <sup>17</sup>My offenses will be sealed up in a bag; <br/>   you will cover over my sin. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_18">  <sup>18</sup>“But as a mountain erodes and crumbles <br/>   and as a rock is moved from its place, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_19">  <sup>19</sup>as water wears away stones <br/>   and torrents wash away the soil, <br/>   so you destroy a person’s hope. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_20">  <sup>20</sup>You overpower them once for all, and they are gone; <br/>   you change their countenance and send them away. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_21">  <sup>21</sup>If their children are honored, they do not know it; <br/>   if their offspring are brought low, they do not see it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_14_22">  <sup>22</sup>They feel but the pain of their own bodies <br/>   and mourn only for themselves.” <br/></span>
