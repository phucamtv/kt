<span class="verse giop_37_1">  <sup>1</sup>“At this my heart pounds <br/>   and leaps from its place. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_2">  <sup>2</sup>Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice, <br/>   to the rumbling that comes from his mouth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_3">  <sup>3</sup>He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven <br/>   and sends it to the ends of the earth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_4">  <sup>4</sup>After that comes the sound of his roar; <br/>   he thunders with his majestic voice. <br/>  When his voice resounds, <br/>   he holds nothing back. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_5">  <sup>5</sup>God’s voice thunders in marvelous ways; <br/>   he does great things beyond our understanding. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_6">  <sup>6</sup>He says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’ <br/>   and to the rain shower, ‘Be a mighty downpour.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_7">  <sup>7</sup>So that everyone he has made may know his work, <br/>   he stops all people from their labor.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or work, / he fills all people with fear by his power">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_8">  <sup>8</sup>The animals take cover; <br/>   they remain in their dens. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_9">  <sup>9</sup>The tempest comes out from its chamber, <br/>   the cold from the driving winds. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_10">  <sup>10</sup>The breath of God produces ice, <br/>   and the broad waters become frozen. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_11">  <sup>11</sup>He loads the clouds with moisture; <br/>   he scatters his lightning through them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_12">  <sup>12</sup>At his direction they swirl around <br/>   over the face of the whole earth <br/>   to do whatever he commands them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_13">  <sup>13</sup>He brings the clouds to punish people, <br/>   or to water his earth and show his love. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_14">  <sup>14</sup>“Listen to this, Job; <br/>   stop and consider God’s wonders. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_15">  <sup>15</sup>Do you know how God controls the clouds <br/>   and makes his lightning flash? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_16">  <sup>16</sup>Do you know how the clouds hang poised, <br/>   those wonders of him who has perfect knowledge? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_17">  <sup>17</sup>You who swelter in your clothes <br/>   when the land lies hushed under the south wind, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_18">  <sup>18</sup>can you join him in spreading out the skies, <br/>   hard as a mirror of cast bronze? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_19">  <sup>19</sup>“Tell us what we should say to him; <br/>   we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_20">  <sup>20</sup>Should he be told that I want to speak? <br/>   Would anyone ask to be swallowed up? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_21">  <sup>21</sup>Now no one can look at the sun, <br/>   bright as it is in the skies <br/>   after the wind has swept them clean. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_22">  <sup>22</sup>Out of the north he comes in golden splendor; <br/>   God comes in awesome majesty. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_23">  <sup>23</sup>The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; <br/>   in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_37_24">  <sup>24</sup>Therefore, people revere him, <br/>   for does he not have regard for all the wise in heart?<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or for he does not have regard for any who think they are wise.">⚓</a> ” <br/></span>
