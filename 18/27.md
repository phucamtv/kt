<div class="title"><h1>27</h1><h3>Job’s Final Word to His Friends </h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_27_1"> <sup>1</sup>And Job continued his discourse: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_2">  <sup>2</sup>“As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice, <br/>   the Almighty, who has made my life bitter, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_3">  <sup>3</sup>as long as I have life within me, <br/>   the breath of God in my nostrils, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_4">  <sup>4</sup>my lips will not say anything wicked, <br/>   and my tongue will not utter lies. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_5">  <sup>5</sup>I will never admit you are in the right; <br/>   till I die, I will not deny my integrity. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_6">  <sup>6</sup>I will maintain my innocence and never let go of it; <br/>   my conscience will not reproach me as long as I live. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_7">  <sup>7</sup>“May my enemy be like the wicked, <br/>   my adversary like the unjust! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_8">  <sup>8</sup>For what hope have the godless when they are cut off, <br/>   when God takes away their life? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_9">  <sup>9</sup>Does God listen to their cry <br/>   when distress comes upon them? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_10">  <sup>10</sup>Will they find delight in the Almighty? <br/>   Will they call on God at all times? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_11">  <sup>11</sup>“I will teach you about the power of God; <br/>   the ways of the Almighty I will not conceal. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_12">  <sup>12</sup>You have all seen this yourselves. <br/>   Why then this meaningless talk? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_13">  <sup>13</sup>“Here is the fate God allots to the wicked, <br/>   the heritage a ruthless man receives from the Almighty: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_14">  <sup>14</sup>However many his children, their fate is the sword; <br/>   his offspring will never have enough to eat. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_15">  <sup>15</sup>The plague will bury those who survive him, <br/>   and their widows will not weep for them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_16">  <sup>16</sup>Though he heaps up silver like dust <br/>   and clothes like piles of clay, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_17">  <sup>17</sup>what he lays up the righteous will wear, <br/>   and the innocent will divide his silver. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_18">  <sup>18</sup>The house he builds is like a moth’s cocoon, <br/>   like a hut made by a watchman. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_19">  <sup>19</sup>He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; <br/>   when he opens his eyes, all is gone. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_20">  <sup>20</sup>Terrors overtake him like a flood; <br/>   a tempest snatches him away in the night. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_21">  <sup>21</sup>The east wind carries him off, and he is gone; <br/>   it sweeps him out of his place. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_22">  <sup>22</sup>It hurls itself against him without mercy <br/>   as he flees headlong from its power. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_27_23">  <sup>23</sup>It claps its hands in derision <br/>   and hisses him out of his place.” <br/></span>
