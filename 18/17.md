<div class="title"><h1>17</h1></div>
<span class="verse giop_17_1">  <sup>1</sup>My spirit is broken, <br/>   my days are cut short, <br/>   the grave awaits me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_17_2">  <sup>2</sup>Surely mockers surround me; <br/>   my eyes must dwell on their hostility. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_17_3">  <sup>3</sup>“Give me, O God, the pledge you demand. <br/>   Who else will put up security for me? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_17_4">  <sup>4</sup>You have closed their minds to understanding; <br/>   therefore you will not let them triumph. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_17_5">  <sup>5</sup>If anyone denounces their friends for reward, <br/>   the eyes of their children will fail. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_17_6">  <sup>6</sup>“God has made me a byword to everyone, <br/>   a man in whose face people spit. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_17_7">  <sup>7</sup>My eyes have grown dim with grief; <br/>   my whole frame is but a shadow. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_17_8">  <sup>8</sup>The upright are appalled at this; <br/>   the innocent are aroused against the ungodly. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_17_9">  <sup>9</sup>Nevertheless, the righteous will hold to their ways, <br/>   and those with clean hands will grow stronger. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_17_10">  <sup>10</sup>“But come on, all of you, try again! <br/>   I will not find a wise man among you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_17_11">  <sup>11</sup>My days have passed, my plans are shattered. <br/>   Yet the desires of my heart <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_17_12">  <sup>12</sup>turn night into day; <br/>   in the face of the darkness light is near. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_17_13">  <sup>13</sup>If the only home I hope for is the grave, <br/>   if I spread out my bed in the realm of darkness, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_17_14">  <sup>14</sup>if I say to corruption, ‘You are my father,’ <br/>   and to the worm, ‘My mother’ or ‘My sister,’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_17_15">  <sup>15</sup>where then is my hope— <br/>   who can see any hope for me? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_17_16">  <sup>16</sup>Will it go down to the gates of death? <br/>   Will we descend together into the dust?” <br/></span>
