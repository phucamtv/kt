<div class="title"><h1>24</h1></div>
<span class="verse giop_24_1">  <sup>1</sup>“Why does the Almighty not set times for judgment? <br/>   Why must those who know him look in vain for such days? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_2">  <sup>2</sup>There are those who move boundary stones; <br/>   they pasture flocks they have stolen. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_3">  <sup>3</sup>They drive away the orphan’s donkey <br/>   and take the widow’s ox in pledge. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_4">  <sup>4</sup>They thrust the needy from the path <br/>   and force all the poor of the land into hiding. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_5">  <sup>5</sup>Like wild donkeys in the desert, <br/>   the poor go about their labor of foraging food; <br/>   the wasteland provides food for their children. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_6">  <sup>6</sup>They gather fodder in the fields <br/>   and glean in the vineyards of the wicked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_7">  <sup>7</sup>Lacking clothes, they spend the night naked; <br/>   they have nothing to cover themselves in the cold. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_8">  <sup>8</sup>They are drenched by mountain rains <br/>   and hug the rocks for lack of shelter. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_9">  <sup>9</sup>The fatherless child is snatched from the breast; <br/>   the infant of the poor is seized for a debt. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_10">  <sup>10</sup>Lacking clothes, they go about naked; <br/>   they carry the sheaves, but still go hungry. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_11">  <sup>11</sup>They crush olives among the terraces<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.">⚓</a> ; <br/>   they tread the winepresses, yet suffer thirst. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_12">  <sup>12</sup>The groans of the dying rise from the city, <br/>   and the souls of the wounded cry out for help. <br/>   But God charges no one with wrongdoing. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_13">  <sup>13</sup>“There are those who rebel against the light, <br/>   who do not know its ways <br/>   or stay in its paths. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_14">  <sup>14</sup>When daylight is gone, the murderer rises up, <br/>   kills the poor and needy, <br/>   and in the night steals forth like a thief. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_15">  <sup>15</sup>The eye of the adulterer watches for dusk; <br/>   he thinks, ‘No eye will see me,’ <br/>   and he keeps his face concealed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_16">  <sup>16</sup>In the dark, thieves break into houses, <br/>   but by day they shut themselves in; <br/>   they want nothing to do with the light. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_17">  <sup>17</sup>For all of them, midnight is their morning; <br/>   they make friends with the terrors of darkness. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_18">  <sup>18</sup>“Yet they are foam on the surface of the water; <br/>   their portion of the land is cursed, <br/>   so that no one goes to the vineyards. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_19">  <sup>19</sup>As heat and drought snatch away the melted snow, <br/>   so the grave snatches away those who have sinned. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_20">  <sup>20</sup>The womb forgets them, <br/>   the worm feasts on them; <br/>  the wicked are no longer remembered <br/>   but are broken like a tree. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_21">  <sup>21</sup>They prey on the barren and childless woman, <br/>   and to the widow they show no kindness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_22">  <sup>22</sup>But God drags away the mighty by his power; <br/>   though they become established, they have no assurance of life. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_23">  <sup>23</sup>He may let them rest in a feeling of security, <br/>   but his eyes are on their ways. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_24">  <sup>24</sup>For a little while they are exalted, and then they are gone; <br/>   they are brought low and gathered up like all others; <br/>   they are cut off like heads of grain. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_24_25">  <sup>25</sup>“If this is not so, who can prove me false <br/>   and reduce my words to nothing?” <br/></span>
