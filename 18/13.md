<span class="verse giop_13_1">  <sup>1</sup>“My eyes have seen all this, <br/>   my ears have heard and understood it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_2">  <sup>2</sup>What you know, I also know; <br/>   I am not inferior to you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_3">  <sup>3</sup>But I desire to speak to the Almighty <br/>   and to argue my case with God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_4">  <sup>4</sup>You, however, smear me with lies; <br/>   you are worthless physicians, all of you! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_5">  <sup>5</sup>If only you would be altogether silent! <br/>   For you, that would be wisdom. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_6">  <sup>6</sup>Hear now my argument; <br/>   listen to the pleas of my lips. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_7">  <sup>7</sup>Will you speak wickedly on God’s behalf? <br/>   Will you speak deceitfully for him? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_8">  <sup>8</sup>Will you show him partiality? <br/>   Will you argue the case for God? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_9">  <sup>9</sup>Would it turn out well if he examined you? <br/>   Could you deceive him as you might deceive a mortal? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_10">  <sup>10</sup>He would surely call you to account <br/>   if you secretly showed partiality. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_11">  <sup>11</sup>Would not his splendor terrify you? <br/>   Would not the dread of him fall on you? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_12">  <sup>12</sup>Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; <br/>   your defenses are defenses of clay. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_13">  <sup>13</sup>“Keep silent and let me speak; <br/>   then let come to me what may. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_14">  <sup>14</sup>Why do I put myself in jeopardy <br/>   and take my life in my hands? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_15">  <sup>15</sup>Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him; <br/>   I will surely<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or He will surely slay me; I have no hope — / yet I will">⚓</a> defend my ways to his face. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_16">  <sup>16</sup>Indeed, this will turn out for my deliverance, <br/>   for no godless person would dare come before him! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_17">  <sup>17</sup>Listen carefully to what I say; <br/>   let my words ring in your ears. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_18">  <sup>18</sup>Now that I have prepared my case, <br/>   I know I will be vindicated. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_19">  <sup>19</sup>Can anyone bring charges against me? <br/>   If so, I will be silent and die. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_20">  <sup>20</sup>“Only grant me these two things, God, <br/>   and then I will not hide from you: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_21">  <sup>21</sup>Withdraw your hand far from me, <br/>   and stop frightening me with your terrors. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_22">  <sup>22</sup>Then summon me and I will answer, <br/>   or let me speak, and you reply to me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_23">  <sup>23</sup>How many wrongs and sins have I committed? <br/>   Show me my offense and my sin. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_24">  <sup>24</sup>Why do you hide your face <br/>   and consider me your enemy? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_25">  <sup>25</sup>Will you torment a windblown leaf? <br/>   Will you chase after dry chaff? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_26">  <sup>26</sup>For you write down bitter things against me <br/>   and make me reap the sins of my youth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_27">  <sup>27</sup>You fasten my feet in shackles; <br/>   you keep close watch on all my paths <br/>   by putting marks on the soles of my feet. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_13_28">  <sup>28</sup>“So man wastes away like something rotten, <br/>   like a garment eaten by moths. <br/><br/></span>
