<div class="title"><h1>15</h1><h3>Eliphaz </h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_15_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_2">  <sup>2</sup>“Would a wise person answer with empty notions <br/>   or fill their belly with the hot east wind? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_3">  <sup>3</sup>Would they argue with useless words, <br/>   with speeches that have no value? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_4">  <sup>4</sup>But you even undermine piety <br/>   and hinder devotion to God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_5">  <sup>5</sup>Your sin prompts your mouth; <br/>   you adopt the tongue of the crafty. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_6">  <sup>6</sup>Your own mouth condemns you, not mine; <br/>   your own lips testify against you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_7">  <sup>7</sup>“Are you the first man ever born? <br/>   Were you brought forth before the hills? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_8">  <sup>8</sup>Do you listen in on God’s council? <br/>   Do you have a monopoly on wisdom? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_9">  <sup>9</sup>What do you know that we do not know? <br/>   What insights do you have that we do not have? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_10">  <sup>10</sup>The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, <br/>   men even older than your father. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_11">  <sup>11</sup>Are God’s consolations not enough for you, <br/>   words spoken gently to you? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_12">  <sup>12</sup>Why has your heart carried you away, <br/>   and why do your eyes flash, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_13">  <sup>13</sup>so that you vent your rage against God <br/>   and pour out such words from your mouth? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_14">  <sup>14</sup>“What are mortals, that they could be pure, <br/>   or those born of woman, that they could be righteous? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_15">  <sup>15</sup>If God places no trust in his holy ones, <br/>   if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_16">  <sup>16</sup>how much less mortals, who are vile and corrupt, <br/>   who drink up evil like water! <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_17">  <sup>17</sup>“Listen to me and I will explain to you; <br/>   let me tell you what I have seen, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_18">  <sup>18</sup>what the wise have declared, <br/>   hiding nothing received from their ancestors <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_19">  <sup>19</sup>(to whom alone the land was given <br/>   when no foreigners moved among them): <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_20">  <sup>20</sup>All his days the wicked man suffers torment, <br/>   the ruthless man through all the years stored up for him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_21">  <sup>21</sup>Terrifying sounds fill his ears; <br/>   when all seems well, marauders attack him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_22">  <sup>22</sup>He despairs of escaping the realm of darkness; <br/>   he is marked for the sword. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_23">  <sup>23</sup>He wanders about for food like a vulture; <br/>   he knows the day of darkness is at hand. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_24">  <sup>24</sup>Distress and anguish fill him with terror; <br/>   troubles overwhelm him, like a king poised to attack, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_25">  <sup>25</sup>because he shakes his fist at God <br/>   and vaunts himself against the Almighty, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_26">  <sup>26</sup>defiantly charging against him <br/>   with a thick, strong shield. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_27">  <sup>27</sup>“Though his face is covered with fat <br/>   and his waist bulges with flesh, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_28">  <sup>28</sup>he will inhabit ruined towns <br/>   and houses where no one lives, <br/>   houses crumbling to rubble. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_29">  <sup>29</sup>He will no longer be rich and his wealth will not endure, <br/>   nor will his possessions spread over the land. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_30">  <sup>30</sup>He will not escape the darkness; <br/>   a flame will wither his shoots, <br/>   and the breath of God’s mouth will carry him away. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_31">  <sup>31</sup>Let him not deceive himself by trusting what is worthless, <br/>   for he will get nothing in return. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_32">  <sup>32</sup>Before his time he will wither, <br/>   and his branches will not flourish. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_33">  <sup>33</sup>He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, <br/>   like an olive tree shedding its blossoms. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_34">  <sup>34</sup>For the company of the godless will be barren, <br/>   and fire will consume the tents of those who love bribes. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_15_35">  <sup>35</sup>They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; <br/>   their womb fashions deceit.” <br/></span>
