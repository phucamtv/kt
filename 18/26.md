<div class="title"><h1>26</h1><h3>Job </h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_26_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Job replied: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_26_2">  <sup>2</sup>“How you have helped the powerless! <br/>   How you have saved the arm that is feeble! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_26_3">  <sup>3</sup>What advice you have offered to one without wisdom! <br/>   And what great insight you have displayed! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_26_4">  <sup>4</sup>Who has helped you utter these words? <br/>   And whose spirit spoke from your mouth? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_26_5">  <sup>5</sup>“The dead are in deep anguish, <br/>   those beneath the waters and all that live in them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_26_6">  <sup>6</sup>The realm of the dead is naked before God; <br/>   Destruction<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew Abaddon">⚓</a> lies uncovered. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_26_7">  <sup>7</sup>He spreads out the northern skies over empty space; <br/>   he suspends the earth over nothing. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_26_8">  <sup>8</sup>He wraps up the waters in his clouds, <br/>   yet the clouds do not burst under their weight. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_26_9">  <sup>9</sup>He covers the face of the full moon, <br/>   spreading his clouds over it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_26_10">  <sup>10</sup>He marks out the horizon on the face of the waters <br/>   for a boundary between light and darkness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_26_11">  <sup>11</sup>The pillars of the heavens quake, <br/>   aghast at his rebuke. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_26_12">  <sup>12</sup>By his power he churned up the sea; <br/>   by his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_26_13">  <sup>13</sup>By his breath the skies became fair; <br/>   his hand pierced the gliding serpent. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_26_14">  <sup>14</sup>And these are but the outer fringe of his works; <br/>   how faint the whisper we hear of him! <br/>   Who then can understand the thunder of his power?” <br/></span>
