<span class="verse giop_30_1">  <sup>1</sup>“But now they mock me, <br/>   men younger than I, <br/>  whose fathers I would have disdained <br/>   to put with my sheep dogs. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_2">  <sup>2</sup>Of what use was the strength of their hands to me, <br/>   since their vigor had gone from them? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_3">  <sup>3</sup>Haggard from want and hunger, <br/>   they roamed<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or gnawed">⚓</a> the parched land <br/>   in desolate wastelands at night. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_4">  <sup>4</sup>In the brush they gathered salt herbs, <br/>   and their food<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or fuel">⚓</a> was the root of the broom bush. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_5">  <sup>5</sup>They were banished from human society, <br/>   shouted at as if they were thieves. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_6">  <sup>6</sup>They were forced to live in the dry stream beds, <br/>   among the rocks and in holes in the ground. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_7">  <sup>7</sup>They brayed among the bushes <br/>   and huddled in the undergrowth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_8">  <sup>8</sup>A base and nameless brood, <br/>   they were driven out of the land. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_9">  <sup>9</sup>“And now those young men mock me in song; <br/>   I have become a byword among them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_10">  <sup>10</sup>They detest me and keep their distance; <br/>   they do not hesitate to spit in my face. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_11">  <sup>11</sup>Now that God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, <br/>   they throw off restraint in my presence. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_12">  <sup>12</sup>On my right the tribe<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.">⚓</a> attacks; <br/>   they lay snares for my feet, <br/>   they build their siege ramps against me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_13">  <sup>13</sup>They break up my road; <br/>   they succeed in destroying me. <br/>   ‘No one can help him,’ they say. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_14">  <sup>14</sup>They advance as through a gaping breach; <br/>   amid the ruins they come rolling in. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_15">  <sup>15</sup>Terrors overwhelm me; <br/>   my dignity is driven away as by the wind, <br/>   my safety vanishes like a cloud. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_16">  <sup>16</sup>“And now my life ebbs away; <br/>   days of suffering grip me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_17">  <sup>17</sup>Night pierces my bones; <br/>   my gnawing pains never rest. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_18">  <sup>18</sup>In his great power God becomes like clothing to me<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew; Septuagint power he grasps my clothing">⚓</a> ; <br/>   he binds me like the neck of my garment. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_19">  <sup>19</sup>He throws me into the mud, <br/>   and I am reduced to dust and ashes. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_20">  <sup>20</sup>“I cry out to you, God, but you do not answer; <br/>   I stand up, but you merely look at me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_21">  <sup>21</sup>You turn on me ruthlessly; <br/>   with the might of your hand you attack me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_22">  <sup>22</sup>You snatch me up and drive me before the wind; <br/>   you toss me about in the storm. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_23">  <sup>23</sup>I know you will bring me down to death, <br/>   to the place appointed for all the living. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_24">  <sup>24</sup>“Surely no one lays a hand on a broken man <br/>   when he cries for help in his distress. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_25">  <sup>25</sup>Have I not wept for those in trouble? <br/>   Has not my soul grieved for the poor? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_26">  <sup>26</sup>Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; <br/>   when I looked for light, then came darkness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_27">  <sup>27</sup>The churning inside me never stops; <br/>   days of suffering confront me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_28">  <sup>28</sup>I go about blackened, but not by the sun; <br/>   I stand up in the assembly and cry for help. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_29">  <sup>29</sup>I have become a brother of jackals, <br/>   a companion of owls. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_30">  <sup>30</sup>My skin grows black and peels; <br/>   my body burns with fever. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_30_31">  <sup>31</sup>My lyre is tuned to mourning, <br/>   and my pipe to the sound of wailing. <br/><br/></span>
