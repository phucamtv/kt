<span class="verse giop_36_1"> <sup>1</sup>Elihu continued: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_2">  <sup>2</sup>“Bear with me a little longer and I will show you <br/>   that there is more to be said in God’s behalf. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_3">  <sup>3</sup>I get my knowledge from afar; <br/>   I will ascribe justice to my Maker. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_4">  <sup>4</sup>Be assured that my words are not false; <br/>   one who has perfect knowledge is with you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_5">  <sup>5</sup>“God is mighty, but despises no one; <br/>   he is mighty, and firm in his purpose. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_6">  <sup>6</sup>He does not keep the wicked alive <br/>   but gives the afflicted their rights. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_7">  <sup>7</sup>He does not take his eyes off the righteous; <br/>   he enthrones them with kings <br/>   and exalts them forever. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_8">  <sup>8</sup>But if people are bound in chains, <br/>   held fast by cords of affliction, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_9">  <sup>9</sup>he tells them what they have done— <br/>   that they have sinned arrogantly. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_10">  <sup>10</sup>He makes them listen to correction <br/>   and commands them to repent of their evil. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_11">  <sup>11</sup>If they obey and serve him, <br/>   they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity <br/>   and their years in contentment. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_12">  <sup>12</sup>But if they do not listen, <br/>   they will perish by the sword<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or will cross the river">⚓</a><br/>   and die without knowledge. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_13">  <sup>13</sup>“The godless in heart harbor resentment; <br/>   even when he fetters them, they do not cry for help. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_14">  <sup>14</sup>They die in their youth, <br/>   among male prostitutes of the shrines. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_15">  <sup>15</sup>But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering; <br/>   he speaks to them in their affliction. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_16">  <sup>16</sup>“He is wooing you from the jaws of distress <br/>   to a spacious place free from restriction, <br/>   to the comfort of your table laden with choice food. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_17">  <sup>17</sup>But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; <br/>   judgment and justice have taken hold of you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_18">  <sup>18</sup>Be careful that no one entices you by riches; <br/>   do not let a large bribe turn you aside. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_19">  <sup>19</sup>Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts <br/>   sustain you so you would not be in distress? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_20">  <sup>20</sup>Do not long for the night, <br/>   to drag people away from their homes.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for verses 18-20 is uncertain.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_21">  <sup>21</sup>Beware of turning to evil, <br/>   which you seem to prefer to affliction. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_22">  <sup>22</sup>“God is exalted in his power. <br/>   Who is a teacher like him? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_23">  <sup>23</sup>Who has prescribed his ways for him, <br/>   or said to him, ‘You have done wrong’? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_24">  <sup>24</sup>Remember to extol his work, <br/>   which people have praised in song. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_25">  <sup>25</sup>All humanity has seen it; <br/>   mortals gaze on it from afar. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_26">  <sup>26</sup>How great is God—beyond our understanding! <br/>   The number of his years is past finding out. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_27">  <sup>27</sup>“He draws up the drops of water, <br/>   which distill as rain to the streams<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or distill from the mist as rain">⚓</a> ; <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_28">  <sup>28</sup>the clouds pour down their moisture <br/>   and abundant showers fall on mankind. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_29">  <sup>29</sup>Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds, <br/>   how he thunders from his pavilion? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_30">  <sup>30</sup>See how he scatters his lightning about him, <br/>   bathing the depths of the sea. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_31">  <sup>31</sup>This is the way he governs<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or nourishes">⚓</a> the nations <br/>   and provides food in abundance. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_32">  <sup>32</sup>He fills his hands with lightning <br/>   and commands it to strike its mark. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_36_33">  <sup>33</sup>His thunder announces the coming storm; <br/>   even the cattle make known its approach.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or announces his coming— / the One zealous against evil">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
