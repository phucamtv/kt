<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>Job </h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Job replied: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_2">  <sup>2</sup>“If only my anguish could be weighed <br/>   and all my misery be placed on the scales! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_3">  <sup>3</sup>It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas— <br/>   no wonder my words have been impetuous. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_4">  <sup>4</sup>The arrows of the Almighty are in me, <br/>   my spirit drinks in their poison; <br/>   God’s terrors are marshaled against me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_5">  <sup>5</sup>Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, <br/>   or an ox bellow when it has fodder? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_6">  <sup>6</sup>Is tasteless food eaten without salt, <br/>   or is there flavor in the sap of the mallow<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this phrase is uncertain.">⚓</a> ? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_7">  <sup>7</sup>I refuse to touch it; <br/>   such food makes me ill. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_8">  <sup>8</sup>“Oh, that I might have my request, <br/>   that God would grant what I hope for, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_9">  <sup>9</sup>that God would be willing to crush me, <br/>   to let loose his hand and cut off my life! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_10">  <sup>10</sup>Then I would still have this consolation— <br/>   my joy in unrelenting pain— <br/>   that I had not denied the words of the Holy One. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_11">  <sup>11</sup>“What strength do I have, that I should still hope? <br/>   What prospects, that I should be patient? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_12">  <sup>12</sup>Do I have the strength of stone? <br/>   Is my flesh bronze? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_13">  <sup>13</sup>Do I have any power to help myself, <br/>   now that success has been driven from me? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_14">  <sup>14</sup>“Anyone who withholds kindness from a friend <br/>   forsakes the fear of the Almighty. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_15">  <sup>15</sup>But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams, <br/>   as the streams that overflow <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_16">  <sup>16</sup>when darkened by thawing ice <br/>   and swollen with melting snow, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_17">  <sup>17</sup>but that stop flowing in the dry season, <br/>   and in the heat vanish from their channels. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_18">  <sup>18</sup>Caravans turn aside from their routes; <br/>   they go off into the wasteland and perish. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_19">  <sup>19</sup>The caravans of Tema look for water, <br/>   the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_20">  <sup>20</sup>They are distressed, because they had been confident; <br/>   they arrive there, only to be disappointed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_21">  <sup>21</sup>Now you too have proved to be of no help; <br/>   you see something dreadful and are afraid. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_22">  <sup>22</sup>Have I ever said, ‘Give something on my behalf, <br/>   pay a ransom for me from your wealth, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_23">  <sup>23</sup>deliver me from the hand of the enemy, <br/>   rescue me from the clutches of the ruthless’? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_24">  <sup>24</sup>“Teach me, and I will be quiet; <br/>   show me where I have been wrong. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_25">  <sup>25</sup>How painful are honest words! <br/>   But what do your arguments prove? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_26">  <sup>26</sup>Do you mean to correct what I say, <br/>   and treat my desperate words as wind? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_27">  <sup>27</sup>You would even cast lots for the fatherless <br/>   and barter away your friend. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_28">  <sup>28</sup>“But now be so kind as to look at me. <br/>   Would I lie to your face? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_29">  <sup>29</sup>Relent, do not be unjust; <br/>   reconsider, for my integrity is at stake.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or my righteousness still stands">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_6_30">  <sup>30</sup>Is there any wickedness on my lips? <br/>   Can my mouth not discern malice? <br/><br/></span>
