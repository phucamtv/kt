<span class="verse giop_5_1">  <sup>1</sup>“Call if you will, but who will answer you? <br/>   To which of the holy ones will you turn? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_2">  <sup>2</sup>Resentment kills a fool, <br/>   and envy slays the simple. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_3">  <sup>3</sup>I myself have seen a fool taking root, <br/>   but suddenly his house was cursed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_4">  <sup>4</sup>His children are far from safety, <br/>   crushed in court without a defender. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_5">  <sup>5</sup>The hungry consume his harvest, <br/>   taking it even from among thorns, <br/>   and the thirsty pant after his wealth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_6">  <sup>6</sup>For hardship does not spring from the soil, <br/>   nor does trouble sprout from the ground. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_7">  <sup>7</sup>Yet man is born to trouble <br/>   as surely as sparks fly upward. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_8">  <sup>8</sup>“But if I were you, I would appeal to God; <br/>   I would lay my cause before him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_9">  <sup>9</sup>He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, <br/>   miracles that cannot be counted. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_10">  <sup>10</sup>He provides rain for the earth; <br/>   he sends water on the countryside. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_11">  <sup>11</sup>The lowly he sets on high, <br/>   and those who mourn are lifted to safety. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_12">  <sup>12</sup>He thwarts the plans of the crafty, <br/>   so that their hands achieve no success. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_13">  <sup>13</sup>He catches the wise in their craftiness, <br/>   and the schemes of the wily are swept away. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_14">  <sup>14</sup>Darkness comes upon them in the daytime; <br/>   at noon they grope as in the night. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_15">  <sup>15</sup>He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth; <br/>   he saves them from the clutches of the powerful. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_16">  <sup>16</sup>So the poor have hope, <br/>   and injustice shuts its mouth. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_17">  <sup>17</sup>“Blessed is the one whom God corrects; <br/>   so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew Shaddai ; here and throughout Job">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_18">  <sup>18</sup>For he wounds, but he also binds up; <br/>   he injures, but his hands also heal. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_19">  <sup>19</sup>From six calamities he will rescue you; <br/>   in seven no harm will touch you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_20">  <sup>20</sup>In famine he will deliver you from death, <br/>   and in battle from the stroke of the sword. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_21">  <sup>21</sup>You will be protected from the lash of the tongue, <br/>   and need not fear when destruction comes. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_22">  <sup>22</sup>You will laugh at destruction and famine, <br/>   and need not fear the wild animals. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_23">  <sup>23</sup>For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, <br/>   and the wild animals will be at peace with you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_24">  <sup>24</sup>You will know that your tent is secure; <br/>   you will take stock of your property and find nothing missing. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_25">  <sup>25</sup>You will know that your children will be many, <br/>   and your descendants like the grass of the earth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_26">  <sup>26</sup>You will come to the grave in full vigor, <br/>   like sheaves gathered in season. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_5_27">  <sup>27</sup>“We have examined this, and it is true. <br/>   So hear it and apply it to yourself.” <br/></span>
