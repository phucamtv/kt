<div class="title"><h1>7</h1></div>
<span class="verse giop_7_1">  <sup>1</sup>“Do not mortals have hard service on earth? <br/>   Are not their days like those of hired laborers? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_2">  <sup>2</sup>Like a slave longing for the evening shadows, <br/>   or a hired laborer waiting to be paid, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_3">  <sup>3</sup>so I have been allotted months of futility, <br/>   and nights of misery have been assigned to me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_4">  <sup>4</sup>When I lie down I think, ‘How long before I get up?’ <br/>   The night drags on, and I toss and turn until dawn. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_5">  <sup>5</sup>My body is clothed with worms and scabs, <br/>   my skin is broken and festering. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_6">  <sup>6</sup>“My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, <br/>   and they come to an end without hope. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_7">  <sup>7</sup>Remember, O God, that my life is but a breath; <br/>   my eyes will never see happiness again. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_8">  <sup>8</sup>The eye that now sees me will see me no longer; <br/>   you will look for me, but I will be no more. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_9">  <sup>9</sup>As a cloud vanishes and is gone, <br/>   so one who goes down to the grave does not return. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_10">  <sup>10</sup>He will never come to his house again; <br/>   his place will know him no more. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_11">  <sup>11</sup>“Therefore I will not keep silent; <br/>   I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit, <br/>   I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_12">  <sup>12</sup>Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep, <br/>   that you put me under guard? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_13">  <sup>13</sup>When I think my bed will comfort me <br/>   and my couch will ease my complaint, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_14">  <sup>14</sup>even then you frighten me with dreams <br/>   and terrify me with visions, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_15">  <sup>15</sup>so that I prefer strangling and death, <br/>   rather than this body of mine. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_16">  <sup>16</sup>I despise my life; I would not live forever. <br/>   Let me alone; my days have no meaning. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_17">  <sup>17</sup>“What is mankind that you make so much of them, <br/>   that you give them so much attention, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_18">  <sup>18</sup>that you examine them every morning <br/>   and test them every moment? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_19">  <sup>19</sup>Will you never look away from me, <br/>   or let me alone even for an instant? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_20">  <sup>20</sup>If I have sinned, what have I done to you, <br/>   you who see everything we do? <br/>  Why have you made me your target? <br/>   Have I become a burden to you?<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="A few manuscripts of the Masoretic Text, an ancient Hebrew scribal tradition and Septuagint; most manuscripts of the Masoretic Text I have become a burden to myself.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_7_21">  <sup>21</sup>Why do you not pardon my offenses <br/>   and forgive my sins? <br/>  For I will soon lie down in the dust; <br/>   you will search for me, but I will be no more.” <br/></span>
