<span class="verse giop_34_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Elihu said: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_2">  <sup>2</sup>“Hear my words, you wise men; <br/>   listen to me, you men of learning. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_3">  <sup>3</sup>For the ear tests words <br/>   as the tongue tastes food. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_4">  <sup>4</sup>Let us discern for ourselves what is right; <br/>   let us learn together what is good. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_5">  <sup>5</sup>“Job says, ‘I am innocent, <br/>   but God denies me justice. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_6">  <sup>6</sup>Although I am right, <br/>   I am considered a liar; <br/>  although I am guiltless, <br/>   his arrow inflicts an incurable wound.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_7">  <sup>7</sup>Is there anyone like Job, <br/>   who drinks scorn like water? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_8">  <sup>8</sup>He keeps company with evildoers; <br/>   he associates with the wicked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_9">  <sup>9</sup>For he says, ‘There is no profit <br/>   in trying to please God.’ <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_10">  <sup>10</sup>“So listen to me, you men of understanding. <br/>   Far be it from God to do evil, <br/>   from the Almighty to do wrong. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_11">  <sup>11</sup>He repays everyone for what they have done; <br/>   he brings on them what their conduct deserves. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_12">  <sup>12</sup>It is unthinkable that God would do wrong, <br/>   that the Almighty would pervert justice. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_13">  <sup>13</sup>Who appointed him over the earth? <br/>   Who put him in charge of the whole world? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_14">  <sup>14</sup>If it were his intention <br/>   and he withdrew his spirit<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Spirit">⚓</a> and breath, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_15">  <sup>15</sup>all humanity would perish together <br/>   and mankind would return to the dust. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_16">  <sup>16</sup>“If you have understanding, hear this; <br/>   listen to what I say. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_17">  <sup>17</sup>Can someone who hates justice govern? <br/>   Will you condemn the just and mighty One? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_18">  <sup>18</sup>Is he not the One who says to kings, ‘You are worthless,’ <br/>   and to nobles, ‘You are wicked,’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_19">  <sup>19</sup>who shows no partiality to princes <br/>   and does not favor the rich over the poor, <br/>   for they are all the work of his hands? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_20">  <sup>20</sup>They die in an instant, in the middle of the night; <br/>   the people are shaken and they pass away; <br/>   the mighty are removed without human hand. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_21">  <sup>21</sup>“His eyes are on the ways of mortals; <br/>   he sees their every step. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_22">  <sup>22</sup>There is no deep shadow, no utter darkness, <br/>   where evildoers can hide. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_23">  <sup>23</sup>God has no need to examine people further, <br/>   that they should come before him for judgment. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_24">  <sup>24</sup>Without inquiry he shatters the mighty <br/>   and sets up others in their place. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_25">  <sup>25</sup>Because he takes note of their deeds, <br/>   he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_26">  <sup>26</sup>He punishes them for their wickedness <br/>   where everyone can see them, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_27">  <sup>27</sup>because they turned from following him <br/>   and had no regard for any of his ways. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_28">  <sup>28</sup>They caused the cry of the poor to come before him, <br/>   so that he heard the cry of the needy. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_29">  <sup>29</sup>But if he remains silent, who can condemn him? <br/>   If he hides his face, who can see him? <br/>  Yet he is over individual and nation alike, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_30">   <sup>30</sup>to keep the godless from ruling, <br/>   from laying snares for the people. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_31">  <sup>31</sup>“Suppose someone says to God, <br/>   ‘I am guilty but will offend no more. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_32">  <sup>32</sup>Teach me what I cannot see; <br/>   if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_33">  <sup>33</sup>Should God then reward you on your terms, <br/>   when you refuse to repent? <br/>  You must decide, not I; <br/>   so tell me what you know. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_34">  <sup>34</sup>“Men of understanding declare, <br/>   wise men who hear me say to me, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_35">  <sup>35</sup>‘Job speaks without knowledge; <br/>   his words lack insight.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_36">  <sup>36</sup>Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost <br/>   for answering like a wicked man! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_34_37">  <sup>37</sup>To his sin he adds rebellion; <br/>   scornfully he claps his hands among us <br/>   and multiplies his words against God.” <br/></span>
