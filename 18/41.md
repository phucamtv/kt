<div class="title"><h1>41</h1></div>
<span class="verse giop_41_1">  <sup>1</sup>“Can you pull in Leviathan with a fishhook <br/>   or tie down its tongue with a rope? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_2">  <sup>2</sup>Can you put a cord through its nose <br/>   or pierce its jaw with a hook? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_3">  <sup>3</sup>Will it keep begging you for mercy? <br/>   Will it speak to you with gentle words? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_4">  <sup>4</sup>Will it make an agreement with you <br/>   for you to take it as your slave for life? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_5">  <sup>5</sup>Can you make a pet of it like a bird <br/>   or put it on a leash for the young women in your house? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_6">  <sup>6</sup>Will traders barter for it? <br/>   Will they divide it up among the merchants? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_7">  <sup>7</sup>Can you fill its hide with harpoons <br/>   or its head with fishing spears? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_8">  <sup>8</sup>If you lay a hand on it, <br/>   you will remember the struggle and never do it again! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_9">  <sup>9</sup>Any hope of subduing it is false; <br/>   the mere sight of it is overpowering. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_10">  <sup>10</sup>No one is fierce enough to rouse it. <br/>   Who then is able to stand against me? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_11">  <sup>11</sup>Who has a claim against me that I must pay? <br/>   Everything under heaven belongs to me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_12">  <sup>12</sup>“I will not fail to speak of Leviathan’s limbs, <br/>   its strength and its graceful form. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_13">  <sup>13</sup>Who can strip off its outer coat? <br/>   Who can penetrate its double coat of armor<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint; Hebrew double bridle">⚓</a> ? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_14">  <sup>14</sup>Who dares open the doors of its mouth, <br/>   ringed about with fearsome teeth? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_15">  <sup>15</sup>Its back has<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Its pride is its">⚓</a> rows of shields <br/>   tightly sealed together; <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_16">  <sup>16</sup>each is so close to the next <br/>   that no air can pass between. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_17">  <sup>17</sup>They are joined fast to one another; <br/>   they cling together and cannot be parted. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_18">  <sup>18</sup>Its snorting throws out flashes of light; <br/>   its eyes are like the rays of dawn. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_19">  <sup>19</sup>Flames stream from its mouth; <br/>   sparks of fire shoot out. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_20">  <sup>20</sup>Smoke pours from its nostrils <br/>   as from a boiling pot over burning reeds. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_21">  <sup>21</sup>Its breath sets coals ablaze, <br/>   and flames dart from its mouth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_22">  <sup>22</sup>Strength resides in its neck; <br/>   dismay goes before it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_23">  <sup>23</sup>The folds of its flesh are tightly joined; <br/>   they are firm and immovable. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_24">  <sup>24</sup>Its chest is hard as rock, <br/>   hard as a lower millstone. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_25">  <sup>25</sup>When it rises up, the mighty are terrified; <br/>   they retreat before its thrashing. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_26">  <sup>26</sup>The sword that reaches it has no effect, <br/>   nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_27">  <sup>27</sup>Iron it treats like straw <br/>   and bronze like rotten wood. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_28">  <sup>28</sup>Arrows do not make it flee; <br/>   slingstones are like chaff to it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_29">  <sup>29</sup>A club seems to it but a piece of straw; <br/>   it laughs at the rattling of the lance. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_30">  <sup>30</sup>Its undersides are jagged potsherds, <br/>   leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_31">  <sup>31</sup>It makes the depths churn like a boiling caldron <br/>   and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_32">  <sup>32</sup>It leaves a glistening wake behind it; <br/>   one would think the deep had white hair. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_33">  <sup>33</sup>Nothing on earth is its equal— <br/>   a creature without fear. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_34">  <sup>34</sup>It looks down on all that are haughty; <br/>   it is king over all that are proud.” <br/></span>
