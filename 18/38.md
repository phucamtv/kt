<span class="verse giop_38_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm. He said: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_2">  <sup>2</sup>“Who is this that obscures my plans <br/>   with words without knowledge? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_3">  <sup>3</sup>Brace yourself like a man; <br/>   I will question you, <br/>   and you shall answer me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_4">  <sup>4</sup>“Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation? <br/>   Tell me, if you understand. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_5">  <sup>5</sup>Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know! <br/>   Who stretched a measuring line across it? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_6">  <sup>6</sup>On what were its footings set, <br/>   or who laid its cornerstone— <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_7">  <sup>7</sup>while the morning stars sang together <br/>   and all the angels<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew the sons of God">⚓</a> shouted for joy? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_8">  <sup>8</sup>“Who shut up the sea behind doors <br/>   when it burst forth from the womb, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_9">  <sup>9</sup>when I made the clouds its garment <br/>   and wrapped it in thick darkness, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_10">  <sup>10</sup>when I fixed limits for it <br/>   and set its doors and bars in place, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_11">  <sup>11</sup>when I said, ‘This far you may come and no farther; <br/>   here is where your proud waves halt’? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_12">  <sup>12</sup>“Have you ever given orders to the morning, <br/>   or shown the dawn its place, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_13">  <sup>13</sup>that it might take the earth by the edges <br/>   and shake the wicked out of it? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_14">  <sup>14</sup>The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; <br/>   its features stand out like those of a garment. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_15">  <sup>15</sup>The wicked are denied their light, <br/>   and their upraised arm is broken. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_16">  <sup>16</sup>“Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea <br/>   or walked in the recesses of the deep? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_17">  <sup>17</sup>Have the gates of death been shown to you? <br/>   Have you seen the gates of the deepest darkness? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_18">  <sup>18</sup>Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth? <br/>   Tell me, if you know all this. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_19">  <sup>19</sup>“What is the way to the abode of light? <br/>   And where does darkness reside? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_20">  <sup>20</sup>Can you take them to their places? <br/>   Do you know the paths to their dwellings? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_21">  <sup>21</sup>Surely you know, for you were already born! <br/>   You have lived so many years! <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_22">  <sup>22</sup>“Have you entered the storehouses of the snow <br/>   or seen the storehouses of the hail, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_23">  <sup>23</sup>which I reserve for times of trouble, <br/>   for days of war and battle? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_24">  <sup>24</sup>What is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed, <br/>   or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_25">  <sup>25</sup>Who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain, <br/>   and a path for the thunderstorm, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_26">  <sup>26</sup>to water a land where no one lives, <br/>   an uninhabited desert, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_27">  <sup>27</sup>to satisfy a desolate wasteland <br/>   and make it sprout with grass? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_28">  <sup>28</sup>Does the rain have a father? <br/>   Who fathers the drops of dew? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_29">  <sup>29</sup>From whose womb comes the ice? <br/>   Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_30">  <sup>30</sup>when the waters become hard as stone, <br/>   when the surface of the deep is frozen? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_31">  <sup>31</sup>“Can you bind the chains<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint; Hebrew beauty">⚓</a> of the Pleiades? <br/>   Can you loosen Orion’s belt? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_32">  <sup>32</sup>Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or the morning star in its season">⚓</a><br/>   or lead out the Bear<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or out Leo">⚓</a> with its cubs? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_33">  <sup>33</sup>Do you know the laws of the heavens? <br/>   Can you set up God’s<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or their">⚓</a> dominion over the earth? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_34">  <sup>34</sup>“Can you raise your voice to the clouds <br/>   and cover yourself with a flood of water? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_35">  <sup>35</sup>Do you send the lightning bolts on their way? <br/>   Do they report to you, ‘Here we are’? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_36">  <sup>36</sup>Who gives the ibis wisdom<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, wisdom about the flooding of the Nile">⚓</a><br/>   or gives the rooster understanding?<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, understanding of when to crow; the meaning of the Hebrew for this verse is uncertain.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_37">  <sup>37</sup>Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? <br/>   Who can tip over the water jars of the heavens <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_38">  <sup>38</sup>when the dust becomes hard <br/>   and the clods of earth stick together? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_39">  <sup>39</sup>“Do you hunt the prey for the lioness <br/>   and satisfy the hunger of the lions <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_40">  <sup>40</sup>when they crouch in their dens <br/>   or lie in wait in a thicket? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_38_41">  <sup>41</sup>Who provides food for the raven <br/>   when its young cry out to God <br/>   and wander about for lack of food? <br/><br/></span>
