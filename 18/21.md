<span class="verse giop_21_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Job replied: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_2">  <sup>2</sup>“Listen carefully to my words; <br/>   let this be the consolation you give me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_3">  <sup>3</sup>Bear with me while I speak, <br/>   and after I have spoken, mock on. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_4">  <sup>4</sup>“Is my complaint directed to a human being? <br/>   Why should I not be impatient? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_5">  <sup>5</sup>Look at me and be appalled; <br/>   clap your hand over your mouth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_6">  <sup>6</sup>When I think about this, I am terrified; <br/>   trembling seizes my body. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_7">  <sup>7</sup>Why do the wicked live on, <br/>   growing old and increasing in power? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_8">  <sup>8</sup>They see their children established around them, <br/>   their offspring before their eyes. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_9">  <sup>9</sup>Their homes are safe and free from fear; <br/>   the rod of God is not on them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_10">  <sup>10</sup>Their bulls never fail to breed; <br/>   their cows calve and do not miscarry. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_11">  <sup>11</sup>They send forth their children as a flock; <br/>   their little ones dance about. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_12">  <sup>12</sup>They sing to the music of timbrel and lyre; <br/>   they make merry to the sound of the pipe. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_13">  <sup>13</sup>They spend their years in prosperity <br/>   and go down to the grave in peace.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or in an instant">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_14">  <sup>14</sup>Yet they say to God, ‘Leave us alone! <br/>   We have no desire to know your ways. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_15">  <sup>15</sup>Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? <br/>   What would we gain by praying to him?’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_16">  <sup>16</sup>But their prosperity is not in their own hands, <br/>   so I stand aloof from the plans of the wicked. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_17">  <sup>17</sup>“Yet how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out? <br/>   How often does calamity come upon them, <br/>   the fate God allots in his anger? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_18">  <sup>18</sup>How often are they like straw before the wind, <br/>   like chaff swept away by a gale? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_19">  <sup>19</sup>It is said, ‘God stores up the punishment of the wicked for their children.’ <br/>   Let him repay the wicked, so that they themselves will experience it! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_20">  <sup>20</sup>Let their own eyes see their destruction; <br/>   let them drink the cup of the wrath of the Almighty. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_21">  <sup>21</sup>For what do they care about the families they leave behind <br/>   when their allotted months come to an end? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_22">  <sup>22</sup>“Can anyone teach knowledge to God, <br/>   since he judges even the highest? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_23">  <sup>23</sup>One person dies in full vigor, <br/>   completely secure and at ease, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_24">  <sup>24</sup>well nourished in body,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.">⚓</a><br/>   bones rich with marrow. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_25">  <sup>25</sup>Another dies in bitterness of soul, <br/>   never having enjoyed anything good. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_26">  <sup>26</sup>Side by side they lie in the dust, <br/>   and worms cover them both. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_27">  <sup>27</sup>“I know full well what you are thinking, <br/>   the schemes by which you would wrong me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_28">  <sup>28</sup>You say, ‘Where now is the house of the great, <br/>   the tents where the wicked lived?’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_29">  <sup>29</sup>Have you never questioned those who travel? <br/>   Have you paid no regard to their accounts— <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_30">  <sup>30</sup>that the wicked are spared from the day of calamity, <br/>   that they are delivered from<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or wicked are reserved for the day of calamity, / that they are brought forth to">⚓</a> the day of wrath? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_31">  <sup>31</sup>Who denounces their conduct to their face? <br/>   Who repays them for what they have done? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_32">  <sup>32</sup>They are carried to the grave, <br/>   and watch is kept over their tombs. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_33">  <sup>33</sup>The soil in the valley is sweet to them; <br/>   everyone follows after them, <br/>   and a countless throng goes<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or them, / as a countless throng went">⚓</a> before them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_21_34">  <sup>34</sup>“So how can you console me with your nonsense? <br/>   Nothing is left of your answers but falsehood!” <br/></span>
