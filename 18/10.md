<span class="verse giop_10_1">  <sup>1</sup>“I loathe my very life; <br/>   therefore I will give free rein to my complaint <br/>   and speak out in the bitterness of my soul. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_2">  <sup>2</sup>I say to God: Do not declare me guilty, <br/>   but tell me what charges you have against me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_3">  <sup>3</sup>Does it please you to oppress me, <br/>   to spurn the work of your hands, <br/>   while you smile on the plans of the wicked? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_4">  <sup>4</sup>Do you have eyes of flesh? <br/>   Do you see as a mortal sees? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_5">  <sup>5</sup>Are your days like those of a mortal <br/>   or your years like those of a strong man, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_6">  <sup>6</sup>that you must search out my faults <br/>   and probe after my sin— <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_7">  <sup>7</sup>though you know that I am not guilty <br/>   and that no one can rescue me from your hand? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_8">  <sup>8</sup>“Your hands shaped me and made me. <br/>   Will you now turn and destroy me? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_9">  <sup>9</sup>Remember that you molded me like clay. <br/>   Will you now turn me to dust again? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_10">  <sup>10</sup>Did you not pour me out like milk <br/>   and curdle me like cheese, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_11">  <sup>11</sup>clothe me with skin and flesh <br/>   and knit me together with bones and sinews? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_12">  <sup>12</sup>You gave me life and showed me kindness, <br/>   and in your providence watched over my spirit. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_13">  <sup>13</sup>“But this is what you concealed in your heart, <br/>   and I know that this was in your mind: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_14">  <sup>14</sup>If I sinned, you would be watching me <br/>   and would not let my offense go unpunished. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_15">  <sup>15</sup>If I am guilty—woe to me! <br/>   Even if I am innocent, I cannot lift my head, <br/>  for I am full of shame <br/>   and drowned in<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or and aware of">⚓</a> my affliction. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_16">  <sup>16</sup>If I hold my head high, you stalk me like a lion <br/>   and again display your awesome power against me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_17">  <sup>17</sup>You bring new witnesses against me <br/>   and increase your anger toward me; <br/>   your forces come against me wave upon wave. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_18">  <sup>18</sup>“Why then did you bring me out of the womb? <br/>   I wish I had died before any eye saw me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_19">  <sup>19</sup>If only I had never come into being, <br/>   or had been carried straight from the womb to the grave! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_20">  <sup>20</sup>Are not my few days almost over? <br/>   Turn away from me so I can have a moment’s joy <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_21">  <sup>21</sup>before I go to the place of no return, <br/>   to the land of gloom and utter darkness, <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_10_22">  <sup>22</sup>to the land of deepest night, <br/>   of utter darkness and disorder, <br/>   where even the light is like darkness.” <br/></span>
