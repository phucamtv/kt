<span class="verse giop_16_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Job replied: <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_2">  <sup>2</sup>“I have heard many things like these; <br/>   you are miserable comforters, all of you! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_3">  <sup>3</sup>Will your long-winded speeches never end? <br/>   What ails you that you keep on arguing? <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_4">  <sup>4</sup>I also could speak like you, <br/>   if you were in my place; <br/>  I could make fine speeches against you <br/>   and shake my head at you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_5">  <sup>5</sup>But my mouth would encourage you; <br/>   comfort from my lips would bring you relief. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_6">  <sup>6</sup>“Yet if I speak, my pain is not relieved; <br/>   and if I refrain, it does not go away. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_7">  <sup>7</sup>Surely, God, you have worn me out; <br/>   you have devastated my entire household. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_8">  <sup>8</sup>You have shriveled me up—and it has become a witness; <br/>   my gauntness rises up and testifies against me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_9">  <sup>9</sup>God assails me and tears me in his anger <br/>   and gnashes his teeth at me; <br/>   my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_10">  <sup>10</sup>People open their mouths to jeer at me; <br/>   they strike my cheek in scorn <br/>   and unite together against me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_11">  <sup>11</sup>God has turned me over to the ungodly <br/>   and thrown me into the clutches of the wicked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_12">  <sup>12</sup>All was well with me, but he shattered me; <br/>   he seized me by the neck and crushed me. <br/>  He has made me his target; <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_13">   <sup>13</sup>his archers surround me. <br/>  Without pity, he pierces my kidneys <br/>   and spills my gall on the ground. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_14">  <sup>14</sup>Again and again he bursts upon me; <br/>   he rushes at me like a warrior. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_15">  <sup>15</sup>“I have sewed sackcloth over my skin <br/>   and buried my brow in the dust. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_16">  <sup>16</sup>My face is red with weeping, <br/>   dark shadows ring my eyes; <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_17">  <sup>17</sup>yet my hands have been free of violence <br/>   and my prayer is pure. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_18">  <sup>18</sup>“Earth, do not cover my blood; <br/>   may my cry never be laid to rest! <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_19">  <sup>19</sup>Even now my witness is in heaven; <br/>   my advocate is on high. <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_20">  <sup>20</sup>My intercessor is my friend<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or My friends treat me with scorn">⚓</a><br/>   as my eyes pour out tears to God; <br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_21">  <sup>21</sup>on behalf of a man he pleads with God <br/>   as one pleads for a friend. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_16_22">  <sup>22</sup>“Only a few years will pass <br/>   before I take the path of no return. <br/><br/></span>
