<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>The Gold Lampstand and the Two Olive Trees </h3></div>
<span class="verse xa_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then the angel who talked with me returned and woke me up, like someone awakened from sleep. </span>
<span class="verse xa_4_2"><sup>2</sup>He asked me, “What do you see?” <br/> I answered, “I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lamps on it, with seven channels to the lamps. </span>
<span class="verse xa_4_3"><sup>3</sup>Also there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_4_4"> <sup>4</sup>I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_4_5"> <sup>5</sup>He answered, “Do you not know what these are?” <br/> “No, my lord,” I replied. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_4_6"> <sup>6</sup>So he said to me, “This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the Lord Almighty. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_4_7"> <sup>7</sup>“What are you, mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become level ground. Then he will bring out the capstone to shouts of ‘God bless it! God bless it!’ ” <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_4_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then the word of the Lord came to me: </span>
<span class="verse xa_4_9"><sup>9</sup>“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple; his hands will also complete it. Then you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_4_10"> <sup>10</sup>“Who dares despise the day of small things, since the seven eyes of the Lord that range throughout the earth will rejoice when they see the chosen capstone<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or the plumb line">⚓</a> in the hand of Zerubbabel?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_4_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then I asked the angel, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_4_12"> <sup>12</sup>Again I asked him, “What are these two olive branches beside the two gold pipes that pour out golden oil?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_4_13"> <sup>13</sup>He replied, “Do you not know what these are?” <br/> “No, my lord,” I said. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_4_14"> <sup>14</sup>So he said, “These are the two who are anointed to<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or two who bring oil and">⚓</a> serve the Lord of all the earth.” <br/></span>
