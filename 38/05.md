<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>The Flying Scroll </h3></div>
<span class="verse xa_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>I looked again, and there before me was a flying scroll. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_5_2"> <sup>2</sup>He asked me, “What do you see?” <br/> I answered, “I see a flying scroll, twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 30 feet long and 15 feet wide or about 9 meters long and 4.5 meters wide">⚓</a> ” <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_5_3"> <sup>3</sup>And he said to me, “This is the curse that is going out over the whole land; for according to what it says on one side, every thief will be banished, and according to what it says on the other, everyone who swears falsely will be banished. </span>
<span class="verse xa_5_4"><sup>4</sup>The Lord Almighty declares, ‘I will send it out, and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in that house and destroy it completely, both its timbers and its stones.’ ” <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Woman in a Basket </h3></div>
<span class="verse xa_5_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then the angel who was speaking to me came forward and said to me, “Look up and see what is appearing.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_5_6"> <sup>6</sup>I asked, “What is it?” <br/> He replied, “It is a basket.” And he added, “This is the iniquity<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or appearance">⚓</a> of the people throughout the land.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_5_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then the cover of lead was raised, and there in the basket sat a woman! </span>
<span class="verse xa_5_8"><sup>8</sup>He said, “This is wickedness,” and he pushed her back into the basket and pushed its lead cover down on it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_5_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then I looked up—and there before me were two women, with the wind in their wings! They had wings like those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between heaven and earth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_5_10"> <sup>10</sup>“Where are they taking the basket?” I asked the angel who was speaking to me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_5_11"> <sup>11</sup>He replied, “To the country of Babylonia<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew Shinar">⚓</a> to build a house for it. When the house is ready, the basket will be set there in its place.” <br/></span>
