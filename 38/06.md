<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>Four Chariots </h3></div>
<span class="verse xa_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>I looked up again, and there before me were four chariots coming out from between two mountains—mountains of bronze. </span>
<span class="verse xa_6_2"><sup>2</sup>The first chariot had red horses, the second black, </span>
<span class="verse xa_6_3"><sup>3</sup>the third white, and the fourth dappled—all of them powerful. </span>
<span class="verse xa_6_4"><sup>4</sup>I asked the angel who was speaking to me, “What are these, my lord?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_6_5"> <sup>5</sup>The angel answered me, “These are the four spirits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or winds">⚓</a> of heaven, going out from standing in the presence of the Lord of the whole world. </span>
<span class="verse xa_6_6"><sup>6</sup>The one with the black horses is going toward the north country, the one with the white horses toward the west,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or horses after them">⚓</a> and the one with the dappled horses toward the south.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_6_7"> <sup>7</sup>When the powerful horses went out, they were straining to go throughout the earth. And he said, “Go throughout the earth!” So they went throughout the earth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_6_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then he called to me, “Look, those going toward the north country have given my Spirit<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or spirit">⚓</a> rest in the land of the north.” <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Crown for Joshua </h3></div>
<span class="verse xa_6_9"> <sup>9</sup>The word of the Lord came to me: </span>
<span class="verse xa_6_10"><sup>10</sup>“Take silver and gold from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon. Go the same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah. </span>
<span class="verse xa_6_11"><sup>11</sup>Take the silver and gold and make a crown, and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jozadak.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew Jehozadak , a variant of Jozadak">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse xa_6_12"><sup>12</sup>Tell him this is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘Here is the man whose name is the Branch, and he will branch out from his place and build the temple of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse xa_6_13"><sup>13</sup>It is he who will build the temple of the Lord, and he will be clothed with majesty and will sit and rule on his throne. And he<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or there">⚓</a> will be a priest on his throne. And there will be harmony between the two.’ </span>
<span class="verse xa_6_14"><sup>14</sup>The crown will be given to Heldai,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Syriac; Hebrew Helem">⚓</a> Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or and the gracious one, the">⚓</a> son of Zephaniah as a memorial in the temple of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse xa_6_15"><sup>15</sup>Those who are far away will come and help to build the temple of the Lord, and you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you. This will happen if you diligently obey the Lord your God.” <br/></span>
