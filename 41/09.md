<div class="title"><h1>9</h1><h3>The Way of the Cross </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>And he said to them, <font color="red">“Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see that the kingdom of God has come with power.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Transfiguration </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_9_2"> <sup>2</sup>After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them. </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_3"><sup>3</sup>His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them. </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_4"><sup>4</sup>And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_5"> <sup>5</sup>Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.” </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_6"><sup>6</sup>(He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.) <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then a cloud appeared and covered them, and a voice came from the cloud: “This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_8"> <sup>8</sup>Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_9"> <sup>9</sup>As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_10"><sup>10</sup>They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what “rising from the dead” meant. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_11"> <sup>11</sup>And they asked him, “Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_12"> <sup>12</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“To be sure, Elijah does come first, and restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they have done to him everything they wished, just as it is written about him.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Heals a Boy Possessed by an Impure Spirit </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_9_14"> <sup>14</sup>When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them. </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_15"><sup>15</sup>As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_16"> <sup>16</sup><font color="red">“What are you arguing with them about?”</font> he asked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_17"> <sup>17</sup>A man in the crowd answered, “Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech. </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_18"><sup>18</sup>Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_19"> <sup>19</sup><font color="red">“You unbelieving generation,”</font> Jesus replied, <font color="red">“how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_20"> <sup>20</sup>So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_21"> <sup>21</sup>Jesus asked the boy’s father, <font color="red">“How long has he been like this?”</font><br/> “From childhood,” he answered. </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_22"><sup>22</sup>“It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_23"> <sup>23</sup><font color="red">“ ‘If you can’?”</font> said Jesus. <font color="red">“Everything is possible for one who believes.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_24"> <sup>24</sup>Immediately the boy’s father exclaimed, “I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_25"> <sup>25</sup>When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the impure spirit. <font color="red">“You deaf and mute spirit,”</font> he said, <font color="red">“I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_26"> <sup>26</sup>The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, “He’s dead.” </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_27"><sup>27</sup>But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_28"> <sup>28</sup>After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_29"> <sup>29</sup>He replied, <font color="red">“This kind can come out only by prayer.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts prayer and fasting">⚓</a><font color="red">”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Predicts His Death a Second Time </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_9_30"> <sup>30</sup>They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were, </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_31"><sup>31</sup>because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, <font color="red">“The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_32"><sup>32</sup>But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_33"> <sup>33</sup>They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, <font color="red">“What were you arguing about on the road?”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_34"><sup>34</sup>But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_35"> <sup>35</sup>Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, <font color="red">“Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_36"> <sup>36</sup>He took a little child whom he placed among them. Taking the child in his arms, he said to them, </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_37"><sup>37</sup><font color="red">“Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Whoever Is Not Against Us Is for Us </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_9_38"> <sup>38</sup>“Teacher,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_39"> <sup>39</sup><font color="red">“Do not stop him,”</font> Jesus said. <font color="red">“For no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me,</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_40"><sup>40</sup><font color="red">for whoever is not against us is for us.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_41"><sup>41</sup><font color="red">Truly I tell you, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to the Messiah will certainly not lose their reward.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Causing to Stumble </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_9_42"> <sup>42</sup><font color="red">“If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them if a large millstone were hung around their neck and they were thrown into the sea.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_43"><sup>43</sup><font color="red">If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_44"><sup>[44]</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts include here the words of verse 48.">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_45"><sup>45</sup><font color="red">And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_46"><sup>[46]</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts include here the words of verse 48.">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_47"><sup>47</sup><font color="red">And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_48"><sup>48</sup><font color="red">where </font><br/>  <font color="red">“ ‘the worms that eat them do not die,</font><br/>   <font color="red">and the fire is not quenched.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 9:48 Isaiah 66:24 ">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_49"><sup>49</sup><font color="red">Everyone will be salted with fire.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_50"> <sup>50</sup><font color="red">“Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt among yourselves, and be at peace with each other.”</font><br/></span>
