<div class="title"><h1>7</h1><h3>That Which Defiles </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_7_1"> <sup>1</sup>The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus </span>
<span class="verse mac_7_2"><sup>2</sup>and saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed. </span>
<span class="verse mac_7_3"><sup>3</sup>(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders. </span>
<span class="verse mac_7_4"><sup>4</sup>When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some early manuscripts pitchers, kettles and dining couches">⚓</a> ) <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_5"> <sup>5</sup>So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, “Why don’t your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with defiled hands?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_6"> <sup>6</sup>He replied, <font color="red">“Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: </font><br/>  <font color="red">“ ‘These people honor me with their lips, </font><br/>   <font color="red">but their hearts are far from me.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_7">  <sup>7</sup><font color="red">They worship me in vain; </font><br/>   <font color="red">their teachings are merely human rules.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 7:7 Isaiah 29:13 ">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_9"> <sup>9</sup>And he continued, <font color="red">“You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts set up">⚓</a><font color="red">your own traditions!</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and mother,’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Exodus 20:12; Deut. 5:16">⚓</a><font color="red">and, ‘Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Exodus 21:17; Lev. 20:9">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is Corban (that is, devoted to God)—</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">then you no longer let them do anything for their father or mother.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_14"> <sup>14</sup>Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, <font color="red">“Listen to me, everyone, and understand this.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_16"><sup>[16]</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts include here the words of 4:23.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_17"> <sup>17</sup>After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. </span>
<span class="verse mac_7_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">“Are you so dull?”</font> he asked. <font color="red">“Don’t you see that nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">For it doesn’t go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of the body.”</font> (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.) <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_20"> <sup>20</sup>He went on: <font color="red">“What comes out of a person is what defiles them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">For it is from within, out of a person’s heart, that evil thoughts come—sexual immorality, theft, murder,</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">All these evils come from inside and defile a person.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Honors a Syrophoenician Woman’s Faith </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_7_24"> <sup>24</sup>Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Many early manuscripts Tyre and Sidon">⚓</a> He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret. </span>
<span class="verse mac_7_25"><sup>25</sup>In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an impure spirit came and fell at his feet. </span>
<span class="verse mac_7_26"><sup>26</sup>The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_27"> <sup>27</sup><font color="red">“First let the children eat all they want,”</font> he told her, <font color="red">“for it is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_28"> <sup>28</sup>“Lord,” she replied, “even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_29"> <sup>29</sup>Then he told her, <font color="red">“For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_30"> <sup>30</sup>She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Heals a Deaf and Mute Man </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_7_31"> <sup>31</sup>Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, the Ten Cities">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_32"><sup>32</sup>There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_33"> <sup>33</sup>After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man’s ears. Then he spit and touched the man’s tongue. </span>
<span class="verse mac_7_34"><sup>34</sup>He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, <em>“Ephphatha!”</em> (which means <font color="red">“Be opened!”</font>). </span>
<span class="verse mac_7_35"><sup>35</sup>At this, the man’s ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_36"> <sup>36</sup>Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it. </span>
<span class="verse mac_7_37"><sup>37</sup>People were overwhelmed with amazement. “He has done everything well,” they said. “He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.” <br/></span>
