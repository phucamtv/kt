<div class="title"><h1>13</h1><h3>The Destruction of the Temple and Signs of the End Times </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_13_1"> <sup>1</sup>As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_2"> <sup>2</sup><font color="red">“Do you see all these great buildings?”</font> replied Jesus. <font color="red">“Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_3"> <sup>3</sup>As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately, </span>
<span class="verse mac_13_4"><sup>4</sup>“Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_5"> <sup>5</sup>Jesus said to them: <font color="red">“Watch out that no one deceives you.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">Many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am he,’ and will deceive many.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth pains.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_9"> <sup>9</sup><font color="red">“You must be on your guard. You will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues. On account of me you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial, do not worry beforehand about what to say. Just say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_12"> <sup>12</sup><font color="red">“Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">Everyone will hate you because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_14"> <sup>14</sup><font color="red">“When you see ‘the abomination that causes desolation’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 13:14 Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11 ">⚓</a><font color="red">standing where it</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or he">⚓</a><font color="red">does not belong—let the reader understand—then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">Let no one on the housetop go down or enter the house to take anything out.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">Pray that this will not take place in winter,</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now—and never to be equaled again.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_20"> <sup>20</sup><font color="red">“If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">At that time if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or, ‘Look, there he is!’ do not believe it.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_24"> <sup>24</sup><font color="red">“But in those days, following that distress, </font><br/>  <font color="red">“ ‘the sun will be darkened, </font><br/>   <font color="red">and the moon will not give its light;</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_25">  <sup>25</sup><font color="red">the stars will fall from the sky, </font><br/>   <font color="red">and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 13:25 Isaiah 13:10; 34:4 ">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_26"> <sup>26</sup><font color="red">“At that time people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_28"> <sup>28</sup><font color="red">“Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that it</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or he">⚓</a><font color="red">is near, right at the door.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Day and Hour Unknown </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_13_32"> <sup>32</sup><font color="red">“But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_33"><sup>33</sup><font color="red">Be on guard! Be alert</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts alert and pray">⚓</a><font color="red">! You do not know when that time will come.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_34"><sup>34</sup><font color="red">It’s like a man going away: He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with their assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_35"> <sup>35</sup><font color="red">“Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back—whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_36"><sup>36</sup><font color="red">If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_13_37"><sup>37</sup><font color="red">What I say to you, I say to everyone: ‘Watch!’ ”</font><br/></span>
