<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>The Parable of the Sower </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water’s edge. </span>
<span class="verse mac_4_2"><sup>2</sup>He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said: </span>
<span class="verse mac_4_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">“Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, some multiplying thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then Jesus said, <font color="red">“Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_10"> <sup>10</sup>When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables. </span>
<span class="verse mac_4_11"><sup>11</sup>He told them, <font color="red">“The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">so that, </font><br/>  <font color="red">“ ‘they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, </font><br/>   <font color="red">and ever hearing but never understanding; </font><br/>  <font color="red">otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 4:12 Isaiah 6:9,10 ">⚓</a><font color="red">”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Don’t you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">The farmer sows the word.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word;</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop—some thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times what was sown.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Lamp on a Stand </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_4_21"> <sup>21</sup>He said to them, <font color="red">“Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don’t you put it on its stand?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">If anyone has ears to hear, let them hear.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_24"> <sup>24</sup><font color="red">“Consider carefully what you hear,”</font> he continued. <font color="red">“With the measure you use, it will be measured to you—and even more.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Growing Seed </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_4_26"> <sup>26</sup>He also said, <font color="red">“This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_28"><sup>28</sup><font color="red">All by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Mustard Seed </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_4_30"> <sup>30</sup>Again he said, <font color="red">“What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds on earth.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_33"> <sup>33</sup>With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand. </span>
<span class="verse mac_4_34"><sup>34</sup>He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Calms the Storm </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_4_35"> <sup>35</sup>That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, <font color="red">“Let us go over to the other side.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_36"><sup>36</sup>Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_4_37"><sup>37</sup>A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped. </span>
<span class="verse mac_4_38"><sup>38</sup>Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care if we drown?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_39"> <sup>39</sup>He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, <font color="red">“Quiet! Be still!”</font> Then the wind died down and it was completely calm. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_40"> <sup>40</sup>He said to his disciples, <font color="red">“Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_41"> <sup>41</sup>They were terrified and asked each other, “Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!” <br/></span>
