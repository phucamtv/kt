<div class="title"><h1>12</h1><h3>The Parable of the Tenants </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_12_1"> <sup>1</sup>Jesus then began to speak to them in parables: <font color="red">“A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_2"><sup>2</sup><font color="red">At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">But they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they killed.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_6"> <sup>6</sup><font color="red">“He had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him last of all, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_7"> <sup>7</sup><font color="red">“But the tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_9"> <sup>9</sup><font color="red">“What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">Haven’t you read this passage of Scripture: </font><br/>  <font color="red">“ ‘The stone the builders rejected </font><br/>   <font color="red">has become the cornerstone;</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_11">  <sup>11</sup><font color="red">the Lord has done this, </font><br/>   <font color="red">and it is marvelous in our eyes’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 12:11 Psalm 118:22,23 ">⚓</a><font color="red">?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and went away. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Paying the Imperial Tax to Caesar </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_12_13"> <sup>13</sup>Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words. </span>
<span class="verse mac_12_14"><sup>14</sup>They came to him and said, “Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. You aren’t swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay the imperial tax<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="A special tax levied on subject peoples, not on Roman citizens">⚓</a> to Caesar or not? </span>
<span class="verse mac_12_15"><sup>15</sup>Should we pay or shouldn’t we?” <br/> But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. <font color="red">“Why are you trying to trap me?”</font> he asked. <font color="red">“Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_16"><sup>16</sup>They brought the coin, and he asked them, <font color="red">“Whose image is this? And whose inscription?”</font><br/> “Caesar’s,” they replied. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s and to God what is God’s.”</font><br/> And they were amazed at him. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Marriage at the Resurrection </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_12_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. </span>
<span class="verse mac_12_19"><sup>19</sup>“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. </span>
<span class="verse mac_12_20"><sup>20</sup>Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children. </span>
<span class="verse mac_12_21"><sup>21</sup>The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third. </span>
<span class="verse mac_12_22"><sup>22</sup>In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too. </span>
<span class="verse mac_12_23"><sup>23</sup>At the resurrection<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts resurrection, when people rise from the dead,">⚓</a> whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_24"> <sup>24</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">Now about the dead rising—have you not read in the Book of Moses, in the account of the burning bush, how God said to him, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Exodus 3:6">⚓</a><font color="red">?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Greatest Commandment </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_12_28"> <sup>28</sup>One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_29"> <sup>29</sup><font color="red">“The most important one,”</font> answered Jesus, <font color="red">“is this: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or The Lord our God is one Lord">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:4,5">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:18">⚓</a><font color="red">There is no commandment greater than these.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_32"> <sup>32</sup>“Well said, teacher,” the man replied. “You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_12_33"><sup>33</sup>To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_34"> <sup>34</sup>When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, <font color="red">“You are not far from the kingdom of God.”</font> And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Whose Son Is the Messiah? </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_12_35"> <sup>35</sup>While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, <font color="red">“Why do the teachers of the law say that the Messiah is the son of David?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_36"><sup>36</sup><font color="red">David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: </font><br/>  <font color="red">“ ‘The Lord said to my Lord:</font><br/>   <font color="red">“Sit at my right hand</font><br/>  <font color="red">until I put your enemies</font><br/>   <font color="red">under your feet.” ’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 12:36 Psalm 110:1 ">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_37"><sup>37</sup><font color="red">David himself calls him ‘Lord.’ How then can he be his son?”</font><br/> The large crowd listened to him with delight. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Warning Against the Teachers of the Law </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_12_38"> <sup>38</sup>As he taught, Jesus said, <font color="red">“Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted with respect in the marketplaces,</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_39"><sup>39</sup><font color="red">and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_40"><sup>40</sup><font color="red">They devour widows’ houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Widow’s Offering </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_12_41"> <sup>41</sup>Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. </span>
<span class="verse mac_12_42"><sup>42</sup>But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_43"> <sup>43</sup>Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, <font color="red">“Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_44"><sup>44</sup><font color="red">They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live on.”</font><br/></span>
