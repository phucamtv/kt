<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>Jesus Heals on the Sabbath </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>Another time Jesus went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_2"><sup>2</sup>Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_3"><sup>3</sup>Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, <font color="red">“Stand up in front of everyone.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then Jesus asked them, <font color="red">“Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?”</font> But they remained silent. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_5"> <sup>5</sup>He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, <font color="red">“Stretch out your hand.”</font> He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_6"><sup>6</sup>Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Crowds Follow Jesus </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_3_7"> <sup>7</sup>Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_8"><sup>8</sup>When they heard about all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_9"><sup>9</sup>Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_10"><sup>10</sup>For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_11"><sup>11</sup>Whenever the impure spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God.” </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_12"><sup>12</sup>But he gave them strict orders not to tell others about him. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Appoints the Twelve </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_3_13"> <sup>13</sup>Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_14"><sup>14</sup>He appointed twelve<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts twelve—designating them apostles—">⚓</a> that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_15"><sup>15</sup>and to have authority to drive out demons. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_16"><sup>16</sup>These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter), </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_17"><sup>17</sup>James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means “sons of thunder”), </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_18"><sup>18</sup>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_19"><sup>19</sup>and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Accused by His Family and by Teachers of the Law </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_3_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_21"><sup>21</sup>When his family<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or his associates">⚓</a> heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, “He is out of his mind.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_22"> <sup>22</sup>And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_23"> <sup>23</sup>So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables: <font color="red">“How can Satan drive out Satan?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">In fact, no one can enter a strong man’s house without first tying him up. Then he can plunder the strong man’s house.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_28"><sup>28</sup><font color="red">Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter,</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_30"> <sup>30</sup>He said this because they were saying, “He has an impure spirit.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_31"> <sup>31</sup>Then Jesus’ mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_32"><sup>32</sup>A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, “Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_33"> <sup>33</sup><font color="red">“Who are my mother and my brothers?”</font> he asked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_34"> <sup>34</sup>Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, <font color="red">“Here are my mother and my brothers!</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">Whoever does God’s will is my brother and sister and mother.”</font><br/></span>
