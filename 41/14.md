<div class="title"><h1>14</h1><h3>Jesus Anointed at Bethany </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_14_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were scheming to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_2"><sup>2</sup>“But not during the festival,” they said, “or the people may riot.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_3"> <sup>3</sup>While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_4"> <sup>4</sup>Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, “Why this waste of perfume? </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_5"><sup>5</sup>It could have been sold for more than a year’s wages<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Greek than three hundred denarii">⚓</a> and the money given to the poor.” And they rebuked her harshly. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_6"> <sup>6</sup><font color="red">“Leave her alone,”</font> said Jesus. <font color="red">“Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">The poor you will always have with you,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="See Deut. 15:11.">⚓</a><font color="red">and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_11"><sup>11</sup>They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Last Supper </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_14_12"> <sup>12</sup>On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus’ disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_13"> <sup>13</sup>So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, <font color="red">“Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">Say to the owner of the house he enters, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_16"> <sup>16</sup>The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_17"> <sup>17</sup>When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve. </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_18"><sup>18</sup>While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, <font color="red">“Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me—one who is eating with me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_19"> <sup>19</sup>They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, “Surely you don’t mean me?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_20"> <sup>20</sup><font color="red">“It is one of the Twelve,”</font> he replied, <font color="red">“one who dips bread into the bowl with me.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_22"> <sup>22</sup>While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, <font color="red">“Take it; this is my body.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_24"> <sup>24</sup><font color="red">“This is my blood of the</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 14:24 Some manuscripts  the new ">⚓</a><font color="red">covenant, which is poured out for many,”</font> he said to them. </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">“Truly I tell you, I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_26"> <sup>26</sup>When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_14_27"> <sup>27</sup><font color="red">“You will all fall away,”</font> Jesus told them, <font color="red">“for it is written: </font><br/>  <font color="red">“ ‘I will strike the shepherd, </font><br/>   <font color="red">and the sheep will be scattered.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 14:27 Zech. 13:7 ">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_28"><sup>28</sup><font color="red">But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_29"> <sup>29</sup>Peter declared, “Even if all fall away, I will not.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_30"> <sup>30</sup><font color="red">“Truly I tell you,”</font> Jesus answered, <font color="red">“today—yes, tonight—before the rooster crows twice</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some early manuscripts do not have twice.">⚓</a><font color="red">you yourself will disown me three times.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_31"> <sup>31</sup>But Peter insisted emphatically, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.” And all the others said the same. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Gethsemane </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_14_32"> <sup>32</sup>They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, <font color="red">“Sit here while I pray.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_33"><sup>33</sup>He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled. </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_34"><sup>34</sup><font color="red">“My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death,”</font> he said to them. <font color="red">“Stay here and keep watch.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_35"> <sup>35</sup>Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_36"><sup>36</sup><em>“Abba,</em><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Aramaic for father">⚓</a><font color="red">Father,”</font> he said, <font color="red">“everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_37"> <sup>37</sup>Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. <font color="red">“Simon,”</font> he said to Peter, <font color="red">“are you asleep? Couldn’t you keep watch for one hour?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_38"><sup>38</sup><font color="red">Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_39"> <sup>39</sup>Once more he went away and prayed the same thing. </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_40"><sup>40</sup>When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_41"> <sup>41</sup>Returning the third time, he said to them, <font color="red">“Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_42"><sup>42</sup><font color="red">Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Arrested </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_14_43"> <sup>43</sup>Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_44"> <sup>44</sup>Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard.” </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_45"><sup>45</sup>Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, “Rabbi!” and kissed him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_46"><sup>46</sup>The men seized Jesus and arrested him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_47"><sup>47</sup>Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_48"> <sup>48</sup><font color="red">“Am I leading a rebellion,”</font> said Jesus, <font color="red">“that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_49"><sup>49</sup><font color="red">Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_50"><sup>50</sup>Then everyone deserted him and fled. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_51"> <sup>51</sup>A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_52"><sup>52</sup>he fled naked, leaving his garment behind. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Before the Sanhedrin </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_14_53"> <sup>53</sup>They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the elders and the teachers of the law came together. </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_54"><sup>54</sup>Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_55"> <sup>55</sup>The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any. </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_56"><sup>56</sup>Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_57"> <sup>57</sup>Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him: </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_58"><sup>58</sup>“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with human hands and in three days will build another, not made with hands.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_59"><sup>59</sup>Yet even then their testimony did not agree. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_60"> <sup>60</sup>Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, “Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?” </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_61"><sup>61</sup>But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. <br/> Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_62"> <sup>62</sup><font color="red">“I am,”</font> said Jesus. <font color="red">“And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_63"> <sup>63</sup>The high priest tore his clothes. “Why do we need any more witnesses?” he asked. </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_64"><sup>64</sup>“You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?” <br/> They all condemned him as worthy of death. </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_65"><sup>65</sup>Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, “Prophesy!” And the guards took him and beat him. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Peter Disowns Jesus </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_14_66"> <sup>66</sup>While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by. </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_67"><sup>67</sup>When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. <br/> “You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus,” she said. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_68"> <sup>68</sup>But he denied it. “I don’t know or understand what you’re talking about,” he said, and went out into the entryway.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some early manuscripts entryway and the rooster crowed">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_69"> <sup>69</sup>When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, “This fellow is one of them.” </span>
<span class="verse mac_14_70"><sup>70</sup>Again he denied it. <br/> After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, “Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_71"> <sup>71</sup>He began to call down curses, and he swore to them, “I don’t know this man you’re talking about.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_14_72"> <sup>72</sup>Immediately the rooster crowed the second time.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some early manuscripts do not have the second time.">⚓</a> Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: <font color="red">“Before the rooster crows twice</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some early manuscripts do not have twice.">⚓</a><font color="red">you will disown me three times.”</font> And he broke down and wept. <br/></span>
