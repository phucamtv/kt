<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>Jesus Comes to Jerusalem as King </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples, </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_2"><sup>2</sup>saying to them, <font color="red">“Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.’ ”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_4"> <sup>4</sup>They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. As they untied it, </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_5"><sup>5</sup>some people standing there asked, “What are you doing, untying that colt?” </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_6"><sup>6</sup>They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_7"><sup>7</sup>When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_8"><sup>8</sup>Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_9"><sup>9</sup>Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, <br/>  “Hosanna!<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="A Hebrew expression meaning “Save!” which became an exclamation of praise; also in verse 10">⚓</a> ” <br/><br/>  “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 118:25,26">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_10">  <sup>10</sup>“Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!” <br/><br/>  “Hosanna in the highest heaven!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_11"> <sup>11</sup>Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Curses a Fig Tree and Clears the Temple Courts </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_11_12"> <sup>12</sup>The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_13"><sup>13</sup>Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_14"><sup>14</sup>Then he said to the tree, <font color="red">“May no one ever eat fruit from you again.”</font> And his disciples heard him say it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_15"> <sup>15</sup>On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves, </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_16"><sup>16</sup>and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_17"><sup>17</sup>And as he taught them, he said, <font color="red">“Is it not written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 56:7">⚓</a><font color="red">? But you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 7:11">⚓</a><font color="red">”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_18"> <sup>18</sup>The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_19"> <sup>19</sup>When evening came, Jesus and his disciples<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some early manuscripts came, Jesus">⚓</a> went out of the city. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_20"> <sup>20</sup>In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_21"><sup>21</sup>Peter remembered and said to Jesus, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_22"> <sup>22</sup><font color="red">“Have faith in God,”</font> Jesus answered. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">“Truly</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some early manuscripts “If you have faith in God,” Jesus answered, 23“truly">⚓</a><font color="red">I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_26"><sup>[26]</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts include here words similar to Matt. 6:15.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Authority of Jesus Questioned </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_11_27"> <sup>27</sup>They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders came to him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_28"><sup>28</sup>“By what authority are you doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave you authority to do this?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_29"> <sup>29</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or of human origin? Tell me!”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_31"> <sup>31</sup>They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’ </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_32"><sup>32</sup>But if we say, ‘Of human origin’ …” (They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.) <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_33"> <sup>33</sup>So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” <br/> Jesus said, <font color="red">“Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</font><br/></span>
