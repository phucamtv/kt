<div class="title"><h1>10</h1><h3>Divorce </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_10_1"> <sup>1</sup>Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_2"> <sup>2</sup>Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_3"> <sup>3</sup><font color="red">“What did Moses command you?”</font> he replied. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_4"> <sup>4</sup>They said, “Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_5"> <sup>5</sup><font color="red">“It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law,”</font> Jesus replied. </span>
<span class="verse mac_10_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">“But at the beginning of creation God ‘made them male and female.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 1:27">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some early manuscripts do not have and be united to his wife.">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">and the two will become one flesh.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:24">⚓</a><font color="red">So they are no longer two, but one flesh.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_10"> <sup>10</sup>When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this. </span>
<span class="verse mac_10_11"><sup>11</sup>He answered, <font color="red">“Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Little Children and Jesus </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_10_13"> <sup>13</sup>People were bringing little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them, but the disciples rebuked them. </span>
<span class="verse mac_10_14"><sup>14</sup>When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, <font color="red">“Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_16"><sup>16</sup>And he took the children in his arms, placed his hands on them and blessed them. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Rich and the Kingdom of God </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_10_17"> <sup>17</sup>As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. “Good teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_18"> <sup>18</sup><font color="red">“Why do you call me good?”</font> Jesus answered. <font color="red">“No one is good—except God alone.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">You know the commandments: ‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, you shall not defraud, honor your father and mother.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Exodus 20:12-16; Deut. 5:16-20">⚓</a><font color="red">”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_20"> <sup>20</sup>“Teacher,” he declared, “all these I have kept since I was a boy.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_21"> <sup>21</sup>Jesus looked at him and loved him. <font color="red">“One thing you lack,”</font> he said. <font color="red">“Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_22"> <sup>22</sup>At this the man’s face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_23"> <sup>23</sup>Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, <font color="red">“How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_24"> <sup>24</sup>The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, <font color="red">“Children, how hard it is</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts is for those who trust in riches">⚓</a><font color="red">to enter the kingdom of God!</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_26"> <sup>26</sup>The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, “Who then can be saved?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_27"> <sup>27</sup>Jesus looked at them and said, <font color="red">“With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_28"> <sup>28</sup>Then Peter spoke up, “We have left everything to follow you!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_29"> <sup>29</sup><font color="red">“Truly I tell you,”</font> Jesus replied, <font color="red">“no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age: homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields—along with persecutions—and in the age to come eternal life.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Predicts His Death a Third Time </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_10_32"> <sup>32</sup>They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_10_33"><sup>33</sup><font color="red">“We are going up to Jerusalem,”</font> he said, <font color="red">“and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles,</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_34"><sup>34</sup><font color="red">who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Request of James and John </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_10_35"> <sup>35</sup>Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. “Teacher,” they said, “we want you to do for us whatever we ask.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_36"> <sup>36</sup><font color="red">“What do you want me to do for you?”</font> he asked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_37"> <sup>37</sup>They replied, “Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_38"> <sup>38</sup><font color="red">“You don’t know what you are asking,”</font> Jesus said. <font color="red">“Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_39"> <sup>39</sup>“We can,” they answered. <br/> Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with,</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_40"><sup>40</sup><font color="red">but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_41"> <sup>41</sup>When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. </span>
<span class="verse mac_10_42"><sup>42</sup>Jesus called them together and said, <font color="red">“You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_43"><sup>43</sup><font color="red">Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_44"><sup>44</sup><font color="red">and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_45"><sup>45</sup><font color="red">For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Blind Bartimaeus Receives His Sight </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_10_46"> <sup>46</sup>Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (which means “son of Timaeus”), was sitting by the roadside begging. </span>
<span class="verse mac_10_47"><sup>47</sup>When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_48"> <sup>48</sup>Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_49"> <sup>49</sup>Jesus stopped and said, <font color="red">“Call him.”</font><br/> So they called to the blind man, “Cheer up! On your feet! He’s calling you.” </span>
<span class="verse mac_10_50"><sup>50</sup>Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_51"> <sup>51</sup><font color="red">“What do you want me to do for you?”</font> Jesus asked him. <br/> The blind man said, “Rabbi, I want to see.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_52"> <sup>52</sup><font color="red">“Go,”</font> said Jesus, <font color="red">“your faith has healed you.”</font> Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road. <br/></span>
