<div class="title"><h1>8</h1><h3>Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>During those days another large crowd gathered. Since they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said, </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_2"><sup>2</sup><font color="red">“I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">If I send them home hungry, they will collapse on the way, because some of them have come a long distance.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_4"> <sup>4</sup>His disciples answered, “But where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_5"> <sup>5</sup><font color="red">“How many loaves do you have?”</font> Jesus asked. <br/> “Seven,” they replied. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_6"> <sup>6</sup>He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people, and they did so. </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_7"><sup>7</sup>They had a few small fish as well; he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them. </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_8"><sup>8</sup>The people ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_9"><sup>9</sup>About four thousand were present. After he had sent them away, </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_10"><sup>10</sup>he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_11"> <sup>11</sup>The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus. To test him, they asked him for a sign from heaven. </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_12"><sup>12</sup>He sighed deeply and said, <font color="red">“Why does this generation ask for a sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to it.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_13"><sup>13</sup>Then he left them, got back into the boat and crossed to the other side. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Yeast of the Pharisees and Herod </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_8_14"> <sup>14</sup>The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat. </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">“Be careful,”</font> Jesus warned them. <font color="red">“Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_16"> <sup>16</sup>They discussed this with one another and said, “It is because we have no bread.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_17"> <sup>17</sup>Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: <font color="red">“Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don’t you remember?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?”</font><br/> “Twelve,” they replied. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_20"> <sup>20</sup><font color="red">“And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?”</font><br/> They answered, “Seven.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_21"> <sup>21</sup>He said to them, <font color="red">“Do you still not understand?”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Heals a Blind Man at Bethsaida </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_8_22"> <sup>22</sup>They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_23"><sup>23</sup>He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man’s eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, <font color="red">“Do you see anything?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_24"> <sup>24</sup>He looked up and said, “I see people; they look like trees walking around.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_25"> <sup>25</sup>Once more Jesus put his hands on the man’s eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_26"><sup>26</sup>Jesus sent him home, saying, <font color="red">“Don’t even go into</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts go and tell anyone in">⚓</a><font color="red">the village.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Peter Declares That Jesus Is the Messiah </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_8_27"> <sup>27</sup>Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, <font color="red">“Who do people say I am?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_28"> <sup>28</sup>They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_29"> <sup>29</sup><font color="red">“But what about you?”</font> he asked. <font color="red">“Who do you say I am?”</font><br/> Peter answered, “You are the Messiah.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_30"> <sup>30</sup>Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Predicts His Death </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_8_31"> <sup>31</sup>He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again. </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_32"><sup>32</sup>He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_33"> <sup>33</sup>But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. <font color="red">“Get behind me, Satan!”</font> he said. <font color="red">“You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_34"> <sup>34</sup>Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: <font color="red">“Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">For whoever wants to save their life</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek word means either life or soul ; also in verses 36 and 37.">⚓</a><font color="red">will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_36"><sup>36</sup><font color="red">What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_37"><sup>37</sup><font color="red">Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_38"><sup>38</sup><font color="red">If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his Father’s glory with the holy angels.”</font><br/></span>
