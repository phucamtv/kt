<div class="title"><h1>1</h1><h3>John the Baptist Prepares the Way </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Jesus Christ. Messiah(Hebrew) and Christ (Greek) both mean Anointed One.">⚓</a> the Son of God,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts do not have the Son of God.">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mac_1_2"><sup>2</sup>as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: <br/>  “I will send my messenger ahead of you, <br/>   who will prepare your way”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 3:1">⚓</a> — <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_1_3">  <sup>3</sup>“a voice of one calling in the wilderness, <br/>  ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, <br/>   make straight paths for him.’ ”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 40:3">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_1_4"><sup>4</sup>And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_5"><sup>5</sup>The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_6"><sup>6</sup>John wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_7"><sup>7</sup>And this was his message: “After me comes the one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_8"><sup>8</sup>I baptize you with<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or in">⚓</a> water, but he will baptize you with<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or in">⚓</a> the Holy Spirit.” <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Baptism and Testing of Jesus </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_1_9"> <sup>9</sup>At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_10"><sup>10</sup>Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_11"><sup>11</sup>And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_1_12"> <sup>12</sup>At once the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness, </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_13"><sup>13</sup>and he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek for tempted can also mean tested .">⚓</a> by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Announces the Good News </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_1_14"> <sup>14</sup>After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">“The time has come,”</font> he said. <font color="red">“The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Calls His First Disciples </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_1_16"> <sup>16</sup>As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">“Come, follow me,”</font> Jesus said, <font color="red">“and I will send you out to fish for people.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_1_18"><sup>18</sup>At once they left their nets and followed him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_1_19"> <sup>19</sup>When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets. </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_20"><sup>20</sup>Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Drives Out an Impure Spirit </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_1_21"> <sup>21</sup>They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_22"><sup>22</sup>The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law. </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_23"><sup>23</sup>Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out, </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_24"><sup>24</sup>“What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_1_25"> <sup>25</sup><font color="red">“Be quiet!”</font> said Jesus sternly. <font color="red">“Come out of him!”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_1_26"><sup>26</sup>The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_1_27"> <sup>27</sup>The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching—and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him.” </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_28"><sup>28</sup>News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Heals Many </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_1_29"> <sup>29</sup>As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_30"><sup>30</sup>Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her. </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_31"><sup>31</sup>So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_1_32"> <sup>32</sup>That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_33"><sup>33</sup>The whole town gathered at the door, </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_34"><sup>34</sup>and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Prays in a Solitary Place </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_1_35"> <sup>35</sup>Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed. </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_36"><sup>36</sup>Simon and his companions went to look for him, </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_37"><sup>37</sup>and when they found him, they exclaimed: “Everyone is looking for you!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_1_38"> <sup>38</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_1_39"><sup>39</sup>So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy </h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_1_40"> <sup>40</sup>A man with leprosy<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek word traditionally translated leprosy was used for various diseases affecting the skin.">⚓</a> came to him and begged him on his knees, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_1_41"> <sup>41</sup>Jesus was indignant.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Many manuscripts Jesus was filled with compassion">⚓</a> He reached out his hand and touched the man. <font color="red">“I am willing,”</font> he said. <font color="red">“Be clean!”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_1_42"><sup>42</sup>Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_1_43"> <sup>43</sup>Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: </span>
<span class="verse mac_1_44"><sup>44</sup><font color="red">“See that you don’t tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_1_45"><sup>45</sup>Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere. <br/></span>
