<div class="title"><h3>The Lord’s Anger Against Nineveh </h3></div>
<span class="verse na_1_2">  <sup>2</sup>The Lord is a jealous and avenging God; <br/>   the Lord takes vengeance and is filled with wrath. <br/>  The Lord takes vengeance on his foes <br/>   and vents his wrath against his enemies. <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_1_3">  <sup>3</sup>The Lord is slow to anger but great in power; <br/>   the Lord will not leave the guilty unpunished. <br/>  His way is in the whirlwind and the storm, <br/>   and clouds are the dust of his feet. <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_1_4">  <sup>4</sup>He rebukes the sea and dries it up; <br/>   he makes all the rivers run dry. <br/>  Bashan and Carmel wither <br/>   and the blossoms of Lebanon fade. <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_1_5">  <sup>5</sup>The mountains quake before him <br/>   and the hills melt away. <br/>  The earth trembles at his presence, <br/>   the world and all who live in it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_1_6">  <sup>6</sup>Who can withstand his indignation? <br/>   Who can endure his fierce anger? <br/>  His wrath is poured out like fire; <br/>   the rocks are shattered before him. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse na_1_7">  <sup>7</sup>The Lord is good, <br/>   a refuge in times of trouble. <br/>  He cares for those who trust in him, <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_1_8">   <sup>8</sup>but with an overwhelming flood <br/>  he will make an end of Nineveh; <br/>   he will pursue his foes into the realm of darkness. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse na_1_9">  <sup>9</sup>Whatever they plot against the Lord<br/>   he will bring<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or What do you foes plot against the Lord? / He will bring it">⚓</a> to an end; <br/>   trouble will not come a second time. <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_1_10">  <sup>10</sup>They will be entangled among thorns <br/>   and drunk from their wine; <br/>   they will be consumed like dry stubble.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this verse is uncertain.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse na_1_11">  <sup>11</sup>From you, Nineveh, has one come forth <br/>   who plots evil against the Lord<br/>   and devises wicked plans. <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_1_12"> <sup>12</sup>This is what the Lord says: <br/>  “Although they have allies and are numerous, <br/>   they will be destroyed and pass away. <br/>  Although I have afflicted you, Judah, <br/>   I will afflict you no more. <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_1_13">  <sup>13</sup>Now I will break their yoke from your neck <br/>   and tear your shackles away.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse na_1_14">  <sup>14</sup>The Lord has given a command concerning you, Nineveh: <br/>   “You will have no descendants to bear your name. <br/>  I will destroy the images and idols <br/>   that are in the temple of your gods. <br/>  I will prepare your grave, <br/>   for you are vile.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse na_1_15">  <sup>15</sup>Look, there on the mountains, <br/>   the feet of one who brings good news, <br/>   who proclaims peace! <br/>  Celebrate your festivals, Judah, <br/>   and fulfill your vows. <br/>  No more will the wicked invade you; <br/>   they will be completely destroyed.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="In Hebrew texts this verse (1:15) is numbered 2:1.">⚓</a><br/></span>
