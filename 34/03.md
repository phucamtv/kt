<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>Woe to Nineveh </h3></div>
<span class="verse na_3_1">  <sup>1</sup>Woe to the city of blood, <br/>   full of lies, <br/>  full of plunder, <br/>   never without victims! <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_3_2">  <sup>2</sup>The crack of whips, <br/>   the clatter of wheels, <br/>  galloping horses <br/>   and jolting chariots! <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_3_3">  <sup>3</sup>Charging cavalry, <br/>   flashing swords <br/>   and glittering spears! <br/>  Many casualties, <br/>   piles of dead, <br/>  bodies without number, <br/>   people stumbling over the corpses— <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_3_4">  <sup>4</sup>all because of the wanton lust of a prostitute, <br/>   alluring, the mistress of sorceries, <br/>  who enslaved nations by her prostitution <br/>   and peoples by her witchcraft. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse na_3_5">  <sup>5</sup>“I am against you,” declares the Lord Almighty. <br/>   “I will lift your skirts over your face. <br/>  I will show the nations your nakedness <br/>   and the kingdoms your shame. <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_3_6">  <sup>6</sup>I will pelt you with filth, <br/>   I will treat you with contempt <br/>   and make you a spectacle. <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_3_7">  <sup>7</sup>All who see you will flee from you and say, <br/>   ‘Nineveh is in ruins—who will mourn for her?’ <br/>   Where can I find anyone to comfort you?” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse na_3_8">  <sup>8</sup>Are you better than Thebes, <br/>   situated on the Nile, <br/>   with water around her? <br/>  The river was her defense, <br/>   the waters her wall. <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_3_9">  <sup>9</sup>Cush<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, the upper Nile region">⚓</a> and Egypt were her boundless strength; <br/>   Put and Libya were among her allies. <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_3_10">  <sup>10</sup>Yet she was taken captive <br/>   and went into exile. <br/>  Her infants were dashed to pieces <br/>   at every street corner. <br/>  Lots were cast for her nobles, <br/>   and all her great men were put in chains. <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_3_11">  <sup>11</sup>You too will become drunk; <br/>   you will go into hiding <br/>   and seek refuge from the enemy. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse na_3_12">  <sup>12</sup>All your fortresses are like fig trees <br/>   with their first ripe fruit; <br/>  when they are shaken, <br/>   the figs fall into the mouth of the eater. <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_3_13">  <sup>13</sup>Look at your troops— <br/>   they are all weaklings. <br/>  The gates of your land <br/>   are wide open to your enemies; <br/>   fire has consumed the bars of your gates. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse na_3_14">  <sup>14</sup>Draw water for the siege, <br/>   strengthen your defenses! <br/>  Work the clay, <br/>   tread the mortar, <br/>   repair the brickwork! <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_3_15">  <sup>15</sup>There the fire will consume you; <br/>   the sword will cut you down— <br/>   they will devour you like a swarm of locusts. <br/>  Multiply like grasshoppers, <br/>   multiply like locusts! <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_3_16">  <sup>16</sup>You have increased the number of your merchants <br/>   till they are more numerous than the stars in the sky, <br/>  but like locusts they strip the land <br/>   and then fly away. <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_3_17">  <sup>17</sup>Your guards are like locusts, <br/>   your officials like swarms of locusts <br/>   that settle in the walls on a cold day— <br/>  but when the sun appears they fly away, <br/>   and no one knows where. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse na_3_18">  <sup>18</sup>King of Assyria, your shepherds<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, rulers">⚓</a> slumber; <br/>   your nobles lie down to rest. <br/>  Your people are scattered on the mountains <br/>   with no one to gather them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_3_19">  <sup>19</sup>Nothing can heal you; <br/>   your wound is fatal. <br/>  All who hear the news about you <br/>   clap their hands at your fall, <br/>  for who has not felt <br/>   your endless cruelty? <br/></span>
