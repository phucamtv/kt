<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Nineveh to Fall </h3></div>
<span class="verse na_2_1">  <sup>1</sup>An attacker advances against you, Nineveh. <br/>   Guard the fortress, <br/>   watch the road, <br/>   brace yourselves, <br/>   marshal all your strength! <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse na_2_2">  <sup>2</sup>The Lord will restore the splendor of Jacob <br/>   like the splendor of Israel, <br/>  though destroyers have laid them waste <br/>   and have ruined their vines. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse na_2_3">  <sup>3</sup>The shields of the soldiers are red; <br/>   the warriors are clad in scarlet. <br/>  The metal on the chariots flashes <br/>   on the day they are made ready; <br/>   the spears of juniper are brandished.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew; Septuagint and Syriac ready; / the horsemen rush to and fro .">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse na_2_4">  <sup>4</sup>The chariots storm through the streets, <br/>   rushing back and forth through the squares. <br/>  They look like flaming torches; <br/>   they dart about like lightning. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse na_2_5">  <sup>5</sup>Nineveh summons her picked troops, <br/>   yet they stumble on their way. <br/>  They dash to the city wall; <br/>   the protective shield is put in place. <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_2_6">  <sup>6</sup>The river gates are thrown open <br/>   and the palace collapses. <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_2_7">  <sup>7</sup>It is decreed<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.">⚓</a> that Nineveh <br/>   be exiled and carried away. <br/>  Her female slaves moan like doves <br/>   and beat on their breasts. <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_2_8">  <sup>8</sup>Nineveh is like a pool <br/>   whose water is draining away. <br/>  “Stop! Stop!” they cry, <br/>   but no one turns back. <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_2_9">  <sup>9</sup>Plunder the silver! <br/>   Plunder the gold! <br/>  The supply is endless, <br/>   the wealth from all its treasures! <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_2_10">  <sup>10</sup>She is pillaged, plundered, stripped! <br/>   Hearts melt, knees give way, <br/>   bodies tremble, every face grows pale. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse na_2_11">  <sup>11</sup>Where now is the lions’ den, <br/>   the place where they fed their young, <br/>  where the lion and lioness went, <br/>   and the cubs, with nothing to fear? <br/></span>
<span class="verse na_2_12">  <sup>12</sup>The lion killed enough for his cubs <br/>   and strangled the prey for his mate, <br/>  filling his lairs with the kill <br/>   and his dens with the prey. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse na_2_13">  <sup>13</sup>“I am against you,” <br/>   declares the Lord Almighty. <br/>  “I will burn up your chariots in smoke, <br/>   and the sword will devour your young lions. <br/>   I will leave you no prey on the earth. <br/>  The voices of your messengers <br/>   will no longer be heard.” <br/></span>
