<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><p>Jerusalem </p></div>
<span class="verse so_3_1">  <sup>1</sup>Woe to the city of oppressors, <br/>   rebellious and defiled! <br/></span>
<span class="verse so_3_2">  <sup>2</sup>She obeys no one, <br/>   she accepts no correction. <br/>  She does not trust in the Lord, <br/>   she does not draw near to her God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse so_3_3">  <sup>3</sup>Her officials within her <br/>   are roaring lions; <br/>  her rulers are evening wolves, <br/>   who leave nothing for the morning. <br/></span>
<span class="verse so_3_4">  <sup>4</sup>Her prophets are unprincipled; <br/>   they are treacherous people. <br/>  Her priests profane the sanctuary <br/>   and do violence to the law. <br/></span>
<span class="verse so_3_5">  <sup>5</sup>The Lord within her is righteous; <br/>   he does no wrong. <br/>  Morning by morning he dispenses his justice, <br/>   and every new day he does not fail, <br/>   yet the unrighteous know no shame. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>Jerusalem Remains Unrepentant </p></div>
<span class="verse so_3_6">  <sup>6</sup>“I have destroyed nations; <br/>   their strongholds are demolished. <br/>  I have left their streets deserted, <br/>   with no one passing through. <br/>  Their cities are laid waste; <br/>   they are deserted and empty. <br/></span>
<span class="verse so_3_7">  <sup>7</sup>Of Jerusalem I thought, <br/>   ‘Surely you will fear me <br/>   and accept correction!’ <br/>  Then her place of refuge<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or her sanctuary">⚓</a> would not be destroyed, <br/>   nor all my punishments come upon<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or all those I appointed over">⚓</a> her. <br/>  But they were still eager <br/>   to act corruptly in all they did. <br/></span>
<span class="verse so_3_8">  <sup>8</sup>Therefore wait for me,” <br/>   declares the Lord, <br/>   “for the day I will stand up to testify.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint and Syriac; Hebrew will rise up to plunder">⚓</a><br/>  I have decided to assemble the nations, <br/>   to gather the kingdoms <br/>  and to pour out my wrath on them— <br/>   all my fierce anger. <br/>  The whole world will be consumed <br/>   by the fire of my jealous anger. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Restoration of Israel’s Remnant </h3></div>
<span class="verse so_3_9">  <sup>9</sup>“Then I will purify the lips of the peoples, <br/>   that all of them may call on the name of the Lord<br/>   and serve him shoulder to shoulder. <br/></span>
<span class="verse so_3_10">  <sup>10</sup>From beyond the rivers of Cush<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, the upper Nile region">⚓</a><br/>   my worshipers, my scattered people, <br/>   will bring me offerings. <br/></span>
<span class="verse so_3_11">  <sup>11</sup>On that day you, Jerusalem, will not be put to shame <br/>   for all the wrongs you have done to me, <br/>  because I will remove from you <br/>   your arrogant boasters. <br/>  Never again will you be haughty <br/>   on my holy hill. <br/></span>
<span class="verse so_3_12">  <sup>12</sup>But I will leave within you <br/>   the meek and humble. <br/>  The remnant of Israel <br/>   will trust in the name of the Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse so_3_13">  <sup>13</sup>They will do no wrong; <br/>   they will tell no lies. <br/>  A deceitful tongue <br/>   will not be found in their mouths. <br/>  They will eat and lie down <br/>   and no one will make them afraid.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse so_3_14">  <sup>14</sup>Sing, Daughter Zion; <br/>   shout aloud, Israel! <br/>  Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, <br/>   Daughter Jerusalem! <br/></span>
<span class="verse so_3_15">  <sup>15</sup>The Lord has taken away your punishment, <br/>   he has turned back your enemy. <br/>  The Lord, the King of Israel, is with you; <br/>   never again will you fear any harm. <br/></span>
<span class="verse so_3_16">  <sup>16</sup>On that day <br/>   they will say to Jerusalem, <br/>  “Do not fear, Zion; <br/>   do not let your hands hang limp. <br/></span>
<span class="verse so_3_17">  <sup>17</sup>The Lord your God is with you, <br/>   the Mighty Warrior who saves. <br/>  He will take great delight in you; <br/>   in his love he will no longer rebuke you, <br/>   but will rejoice over you with singing.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse so_3_18">  <sup>18</sup>“I will remove from you <br/>   all who mourn over the loss of your appointed festivals, <br/>   which is a burden and reproach for you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse so_3_19">  <sup>19</sup>At that time I will deal <br/>   with all who oppressed you. <br/>  I will rescue the lame; <br/>   I will gather the exiles. <br/>  I will give them praise and honor <br/>   in every land where they have suffered shame. <br/></span>
<span class="verse so_3_20">  <sup>20</sup>At that time I will gather you; <br/>   at that time I will bring you home. <br/>  I will give you honor and praise <br/>   among all the peoples of the earth <br/>  when I restore your fortunes<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or I bring back your captives">⚓</a><br/>   before your very eyes,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">says the Lord.. </aside><br/></span>
