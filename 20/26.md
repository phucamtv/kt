<span class="verse ch_26_14">  <sup>14</sup>As a door turns on its hinges, <br/>   so a sluggard turns on his bed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_26_15">  <sup>15</sup>A sluggard buries his hand in the dish; <br/>   he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_26_16">  <sup>16</sup>A sluggard is wiser in his own eyes <br/>   than seven people who answer discreetly. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_26_17">  <sup>17</sup>Like one who grabs a stray dog by the ears <br/>   is someone who rushes into a quarrel not their own. <br/><br/></span>

<span class="verse ch_26_21">  <sup>21</sup>As charcoal to embers and as wood to fire, <br/>   so is a quarrelsome person for kindling strife. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_26_22">  <sup>22</sup>The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; <br/>   they go down to the inmost parts. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_26_23">  <sup>23</sup>Like a coating of silver dross on earthenware <br/>   are fervent<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew; Septuagint smooth">⚓</a> lips with an evil heart. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_26_24">  <sup>24</sup>Enemies disguise themselves with their lips, <br/>   but in their hearts they harbor deceit. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_26_25">  <sup>25</sup>Though their speech is charming, do not believe them, <br/>   for seven abominations fill their hearts. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_26_26">  <sup>26</sup>Their malice may be concealed by deception, <br/>   but their wickedness will be exposed in the assembly. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_26_27">  <sup>27</sup>Whoever digs a pit will fall into it; <br/>   if someone rolls a stone, it will roll back on them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_26_28">  <sup>28</sup>A lying tongue hates those it hurts, <br/>   and a flattering mouth works ruin. <br/><br/></span>
