<span class="verse ch_3_1">  <sup>1</sup>My son, do not forget my teaching, <br/>   but keep my commands in your heart, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_2">  <sup>2</sup>for they will prolong your life many years <br/>   and bring you peace and prosperity. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_3">  <sup>3</sup>Let love and faithfulness never leave you; <br/>   bind them around your neck, <br/>   write them on the tablet of your heart. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_4">  <sup>4</sup>Then you will win favor and a good name <br/>   in the sight of God and man. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_5">  <sup>5</sup>Trust in the Lord with all your heart <br/>   and lean not on your own understanding; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_6">  <sup>6</sup>in all your ways submit to him, <br/>   and he will make your paths straight.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or will direct your paths">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_7">  <sup>7</sup>Do not be wise in your own eyes; <br/>   fear the Lord and shun evil. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_8">  <sup>8</sup>This will bring health to your body <br/>   and nourishment to your bones. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_9">  <sup>9</sup>Honor the Lord with your wealth, <br/>   with the firstfruits of all your crops; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_10">  <sup>10</sup>then your barns will be filled to overflowing, <br/>   and your vats will brim over with new wine. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_11">  <sup>11</sup>My son, do not despise the Lord’s discipline, <br/>   and do not resent his rebuke, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_12">  <sup>12</sup>because the Lord disciplines those he loves, <br/>   as a father the son he delights in.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew; Septuagint loves, / and he chastens everyone he accepts as his child">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_13">  <sup>13</sup>Blessed are those who find wisdom, <br/>   those who gain understanding, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_14">  <sup>14</sup>for she is more profitable than silver <br/>   and yields better returns than gold. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_15">  <sup>15</sup>She is more precious than rubies; <br/>   nothing you desire can compare with her. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_16">  <sup>16</sup>Long life is in her right hand; <br/>   in her left hand are riches and honor. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_17">  <sup>17</sup>Her ways are pleasant ways, <br/>   and all her paths are peace. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_18">  <sup>18</sup>She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her; <br/>   those who hold her fast will be blessed. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_19">  <sup>19</sup>By wisdom the Lord laid the earth’s foundations, <br/>   by understanding he set the heavens in place; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_20">  <sup>20</sup>by his knowledge the watery depths were divided, <br/>   and the clouds let drop the dew. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_21">  <sup>21</sup>My son, do not let wisdom and understanding out of your sight, <br/>   preserve sound judgment and discretion; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_22">  <sup>22</sup>they will be life for you, <br/>   an ornament to grace your neck. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_23">  <sup>23</sup>Then you will go on your way in safety, <br/>   and your foot will not stumble. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_24">  <sup>24</sup>When you lie down, you will not be afraid; <br/>   when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_25">  <sup>25</sup>Have no fear of sudden disaster <br/>   or of the ruin that overtakes the wicked, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_26">  <sup>26</sup>for the Lord will be at your side <br/>   and will keep your foot from being snared. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_27">  <sup>27</sup>Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, <br/>   when it is in your power to act. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_28">  <sup>28</sup>Do not say to your neighbor, <br/>   “Come back tomorrow and I’ll give it to you”— <br/>   when you already have it with you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_29">  <sup>29</sup>Do not plot harm against your neighbor, <br/>   who lives trustfully near you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_30">  <sup>30</sup>Do not accuse anyone for no reason— <br/>   when they have done you no harm. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_31">  <sup>31</sup>Do not envy the violent <br/>   or choose any of their ways. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_32">  <sup>32</sup>For the Lord detests the perverse <br/>   but takes the upright into his confidence. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_33">  <sup>33</sup>The Lord’s curse is on the house of the wicked, <br/>   but he blesses the home of the righteous. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_34">  <sup>34</sup>He mocks proud mockers <br/>   but shows favor to the humble and oppressed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_3_35">  <sup>35</sup>The wise inherit honor, <br/>   but fools get only shame. <br/></span>
