<div class="title"><h1>7</h1><h3>Warning Against the Adulterous Woman </h3></div>
<span class="verse ch_7_1">  <sup>1</sup>My son, keep my words <br/>   and store up my commands within you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_2">  <sup>2</sup>Keep my commands and you will live; <br/>   guard my teachings as the apple of your eye. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_3">  <sup>3</sup>Bind them on your fingers; <br/>   write them on the tablet of your heart. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_4">  <sup>4</sup>Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” <br/>   and to insight, “You are my relative.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_5">  <sup>5</sup>They will keep you from the adulterous woman, <br/>   from the wayward woman with her seductive words. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_6">  <sup>6</sup>At the window of my house <br/>   I looked down through the lattice. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_7">  <sup>7</sup>I saw among the simple, <br/>   I noticed among the young men, <br/>   a youth who had no sense. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_8">  <sup>8</sup>He was going down the street near her corner, <br/>   walking along in the direction of her house <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_9">  <sup>9</sup>at twilight, as the day was fading, <br/>   as the dark of night set in. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_10">  <sup>10</sup>Then out came a woman to meet him, <br/>   dressed like a prostitute and with crafty intent. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_11">  <sup>11</sup>(She is unruly and defiant, <br/>   her feet never stay at home; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_12">  <sup>12</sup>now in the street, now in the squares, <br/>   at every corner she lurks.) <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_13">  <sup>13</sup>She took hold of him and kissed him <br/>   and with a brazen face she said: <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_14">  <sup>14</sup>“Today I fulfilled my vows, <br/>   and I have food from my fellowship offering at home. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_15">  <sup>15</sup>So I came out to meet you; <br/>   I looked for you and have found you! <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_16">  <sup>16</sup>I have covered my bed <br/>   with colored linens from Egypt. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_17">  <sup>17</sup>I have perfumed my bed <br/>   with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_18">  <sup>18</sup>Come, let’s drink deeply of love till morning; <br/>   let’s enjoy ourselves with love! <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_19">  <sup>19</sup>My husband is not at home; <br/>   he has gone on a long journey. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_20">  <sup>20</sup>He took his purse filled with money <br/>   and will not be home till full moon.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_21">  <sup>21</sup>With persuasive words she led him astray; <br/>   she seduced him with her smooth talk. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_22">  <sup>22</sup>All at once he followed her <br/>   like an ox going to the slaughter, <br/>  like a deer<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Syriac (see also Septuagint); Hebrew fool">⚓</a> stepping into a noose<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this line is uncertain.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_23">   <sup>23</sup>till an arrow pierces his liver, <br/>  like a bird darting into a snare, <br/>   little knowing it will cost him his life. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_24">  <sup>24</sup>Now then, my sons, listen to me; <br/>   pay attention to what I say. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_25">  <sup>25</sup>Do not let your heart turn to her ways <br/>   or stray into her paths. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_26">  <sup>26</sup>Many are the victims she has brought down; <br/>   her slain are a mighty throng. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_7_27">  <sup>27</sup>Her house is a highway to the grave, <br/>   leading down to the chambers of death. <br/></span>
