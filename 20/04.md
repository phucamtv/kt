<span class="verse ch_4_2">  <sup>2</sup>I give you sound learning, <br/>   so do not forsake my teaching. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_4_3">  <sup>3</sup>For I too was a son to my father, <br/>   still tender, and cherished by my mother. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_4_4">  <sup>4</sup>Then he taught me, and he said to me, <br/>   “Take hold of my words with all your heart; <br/>   keep my commands, and you will live. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_4_5">  <sup>5</sup>Get wisdom, get understanding; <br/>   do not forget my words or turn away from them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_4_6">  <sup>6</sup>Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you; <br/>   love her, and she will watch over you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_4_7">  <sup>7</sup>The beginning of wisdom is this: Get<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Wisdom is supreme; therefore get">⚓</a> wisdom. <br/>   Though it cost all you have,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or wisdom. / Whatever else you get">⚓</a> get understanding. <br/></span>

<span class="verse ch_4_13">  <sup>13</sup>Hold on to instruction, do not let it go; <br/>   guard it well, for it is your life. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_4_14">  <sup>14</sup>Do not set foot on the path of the wicked <br/>   or walk in the way of evildoers. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_4_15">  <sup>15</sup>Avoid it, do not travel on it; <br/>   turn from it and go on your way. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_4_16">  <sup>16</sup>For they cannot rest until they do evil; <br/>   they are robbed of sleep till they make someone stumble. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_4_17">  <sup>17</sup>They eat the bread of wickedness <br/>   and drink the wine of violence. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_4_18">  <sup>18</sup>The path of the righteous is like the morning sun, <br/>   shining ever brighter till the full light of day. <br/></span>

<span class="verse ch_4_20">  <sup>20</sup>My son, pay attention to what I say; <br/>   turn your ear to my words. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_4_21">  <sup>21</sup>Do not let them out of your sight, <br/>   keep them within your heart; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_4_22">  <sup>22</sup>for they are life to those who find them <br/>   and health to one’s whole body. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_4_23">  <sup>23</sup>Above all else, guard your heart, <br/>   for everything you do flows from it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_4_24">  <sup>24</sup>Keep your mouth free of perversity; <br/>   keep corrupt talk far from your lips. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_4_25">  <sup>25</sup>Let your eyes look straight ahead; <br/>   fix your gaze directly before you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_4_26">  <sup>26</sup>Give careful thought to the<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Make level">⚓</a> paths for your feet <br/>   and be steadfast in all your ways. <br/></span>
