<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Moral Benefits of Wisdom </h3></div>
<span class="verse ch_2_1">  <sup>1</sup>My son, if you accept my words <br/>   and store up my commands within you, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_2">  <sup>2</sup>turning your ear to wisdom <br/>   and applying your heart to understanding— <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_3">  <sup>3</sup>indeed, if you call out for insight <br/>   and cry aloud for understanding, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_4">  <sup>4</sup>and if you look for it as for silver <br/>   and search for it as for hidden treasure, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_5">  <sup>5</sup>then you will understand the fear of the Lord<br/>   and find the knowledge of God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_6">  <sup>6</sup>For the Lord gives wisdom; <br/>   from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_7">  <sup>7</sup>He holds success in store for the upright, <br/>   he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_8">  <sup>8</sup>for he guards the course of the just <br/>   and protects the way of his faithful ones. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_9">  <sup>9</sup>Then you will understand what is right and just <br/>   and fair—every good path. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_10">  <sup>10</sup>For wisdom will enter your heart, <br/>   and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_11">  <sup>11</sup>Discretion will protect you, <br/>   and understanding will guard you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_12">  <sup>12</sup>Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men, <br/>   from men whose words are perverse, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_13">  <sup>13</sup>who have left the straight paths <br/>   to walk in dark ways, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_14">  <sup>14</sup>who delight in doing wrong <br/>   and rejoice in the perverseness of evil, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_15">  <sup>15</sup>whose paths are crooked <br/>   and who are devious in their ways. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_16">  <sup>16</sup>Wisdom will save you also from the adulterous woman, <br/>   from the wayward woman with her seductive words, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_17">  <sup>17</sup>who has left the partner of her youth <br/>   and ignored the covenant she made before God.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or covenant of her God">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_18">  <sup>18</sup>Surely her house leads down to death <br/>   and her paths to the spirits of the dead. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_19">  <sup>19</sup>None who go to her return <br/>   or attain the paths of life. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_20">  <sup>20</sup>Thus you will walk in the ways of the good <br/>   and keep to the paths of the righteous. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_21">  <sup>21</sup>For the upright will live in the land, <br/>   and the blameless will remain in it; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_2_22">  <sup>22</sup>but the wicked will be cut off from the land, <br/>   and the unfaithful will be torn from it. <br/></span>
