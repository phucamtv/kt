<div class="title"><h1>9</h1><h3>Invitations of Wisdom and Folly </h3></div>
<span class="verse ch_9_1">  <sup>1</sup>Wisdom has built her house; <br/>   she has set up<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint, Syriac and Targum; Hebrew has hewn out">⚓</a> its seven pillars. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_9_2">  <sup>2</sup>She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine; <br/>   she has also set her table. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_9_3">  <sup>3</sup>She has sent out her servants, and she calls <br/>   from the highest point of the city, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_9_4">   <sup>4</sup>“Let all who are simple come to my house!” <br/>  To those who have no sense she says, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_9_5">   <sup>5</sup>“Come, eat my food <br/>   and drink the wine I have mixed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_9_6">  <sup>6</sup>Leave your simple ways and you will live; <br/>   walk in the way of insight.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_9_7">  <sup>7</sup>Whoever corrects a mocker invites insults; <br/>   whoever rebukes the wicked incurs abuse. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_9_8">  <sup>8</sup>Do not rebuke mockers or they will hate you; <br/>   rebuke the wise and they will love you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_9_9">  <sup>9</sup>Instruct the wise and they will be wiser still; <br/>   teach the righteous and they will add to their learning. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_9_10">  <sup>10</sup>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, <br/>   and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_9_11">  <sup>11</sup>For through wisdom<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint, Syriac and Targum; Hebrew me">⚓</a> your days will be many, <br/>   and years will be added to your life. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_9_12">  <sup>12</sup>If you are wise, your wisdom will reward you; <br/>   if you are a mocker, you alone will suffer. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_9_13">  <sup>13</sup>Folly is an unruly woman; <br/>   she is simple and knows nothing. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_9_14">  <sup>14</sup>She sits at the door of her house, <br/>   on a seat at the highest point of the city, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_9_15">  <sup>15</sup>calling out to those who pass by, <br/>   who go straight on their way, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_9_16">   <sup>16</sup>“Let all who are simple come to my house!” <br/>  To those who have no sense she says, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_9_17">   <sup>17</sup>“Stolen water is sweet; <br/>   food eaten in secret is delicious!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_9_18">  <sup>18</sup>But little do they know that the dead are there, <br/>   that her guests are deep in the realm of the dead. <br/></span>
