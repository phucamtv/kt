<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>Warning Against Adultery </h3></div>
<span class="verse ch_5_1">  <sup>1</sup>My son, pay attention to my wisdom, <br/>   turn your ear to my words of insight, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_2">  <sup>2</sup>that you may maintain discretion <br/>   and your lips may preserve knowledge. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_3">  <sup>3</sup>For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey, <br/>   and her speech is smoother than oil; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_4">  <sup>4</sup>but in the end she is bitter as gall, <br/>   sharp as a double-edged sword. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_5">  <sup>5</sup>Her feet go down to death; <br/>   her steps lead straight to the grave. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_6">  <sup>6</sup>She gives no thought to the way of life; <br/>   her paths wander aimlessly, but she does not know it. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_7">  <sup>7</sup>Now then, my sons, listen to me; <br/>   do not turn aside from what I say. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_8">  <sup>8</sup>Keep to a path far from her, <br/>   do not go near the door of her house, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_9">  <sup>9</sup>lest you lose your honor to others <br/>   and your dignity<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or years">⚓</a> to one who is cruel, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_10">  <sup>10</sup>lest strangers feast on your wealth <br/>   and your toil enrich the house of another. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_11">  <sup>11</sup>At the end of your life you will groan, <br/>   when your flesh and body are spent. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_12">  <sup>12</sup>You will say, “How I hated discipline! <br/>   How my heart spurned correction! <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_13">  <sup>13</sup>I would not obey my teachers <br/>   or turn my ear to my instructors. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_14">  <sup>14</sup>And I was soon in serious trouble <br/>   in the assembly of God’s people.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_15">  <sup>15</sup>Drink water from your own cistern, <br/>   running water from your own well. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_16">  <sup>16</sup>Should your springs overflow in the streets, <br/>   your streams of water in the public squares? <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_17">  <sup>17</sup>Let them be yours alone, <br/>   never to be shared with strangers. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_18">  <sup>18</sup>May your fountain be blessed, <br/>   and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_19">  <sup>19</sup>A loving doe, a graceful deer— <br/>   may her breasts satisfy you always, <br/>   may you ever be intoxicated with her love. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_20">  <sup>20</sup>Why, my son, be intoxicated with another man’s wife? <br/>   Why embrace the bosom of a wayward woman? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_21">  <sup>21</sup>For your ways are in full view of the Lord, <br/>   and he examines all your paths. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_22">  <sup>22</sup>The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare them; <br/>   the cords of their sins hold them fast. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_5_23">  <sup>23</sup>For lack of discipline they will die, <br/>   led astray by their own great folly. <br/></span>
