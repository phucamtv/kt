<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>Warnings Against Folly </h3></div>
<span class="verse ch_6_1">  <sup>1</sup>My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, <br/>   if you have shaken hands in pledge for a stranger, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_2">  <sup>2</sup>you have been trapped by what you said, <br/>   ensnared by the words of your mouth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_3">  <sup>3</sup>So do this, my son, to free yourself, <br/>   since you have fallen into your neighbor’s hands: <br/>  Go—to the point of exhaustion—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Go and humble yourself,">⚓</a><br/>   and give your neighbor no rest! <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_4">  <sup>4</sup>Allow no sleep to your eyes, <br/>   no slumber to your eyelids. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_5">  <sup>5</sup>Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, <br/>   like a bird from the snare of the fowler. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_6">  <sup>6</sup>Go to the ant, you sluggard; <br/>   consider its ways and be wise! <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_7">  <sup>7</sup>It has no commander, <br/>   no overseer or ruler, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_8">  <sup>8</sup>yet it stores its provisions in summer <br/>   and gathers its food at harvest. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_9">  <sup>9</sup>How long will you lie there, you sluggard? <br/>   When will you get up from your sleep? <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_10">  <sup>10</sup>A little sleep, a little slumber, <br/>   a little folding of the hands to rest— <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_11">  <sup>11</sup>and poverty will come on you like a thief <br/>   and scarcity like an armed man. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_12">  <sup>12</sup>A troublemaker and a villain, <br/>   who goes about with a corrupt mouth, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_13">   <sup>13</sup>who winks maliciously with his eye, <br/>   signals with his feet <br/>   and motions with his fingers, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_14">   <sup>14</sup>who plots evil with deceit in his heart— <br/>   he always stirs up conflict. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_15">  <sup>15</sup>Therefore disaster will overtake him in an instant; <br/>   he will suddenly be destroyed—without remedy. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_16">  <sup>16</sup>There are six things the Lord hates, <br/>   seven that are detestable to him: <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_17">    <sup>17</sup>haughty eyes, <br/>    a lying tongue, <br/>    hands that shed innocent blood, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_18">    <sup>18</sup>a heart that devises wicked schemes, <br/>    feet that are quick to rush into evil, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_19">    <sup>19</sup>a false witness who pours out lies <br/>    and a person who stirs up conflict in the community. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Warning Against Adultery </h3></div>
<span class="verse ch_6_20">  <sup>20</sup>My son, keep your father’s command <br/>   and do not forsake your mother’s teaching. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_21">  <sup>21</sup>Bind them always on your heart; <br/>   fasten them around your neck. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_22">  <sup>22</sup>When you walk, they will guide you; <br/>   when you sleep, they will watch over you; <br/>   when you awake, they will speak to you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_23">  <sup>23</sup>For this command is a lamp, <br/>   this teaching is a light, <br/>  and correction and instruction <br/>   are the way to life, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_24">  <sup>24</sup>keeping you from your neighbor’s wife, <br/>   from the smooth talk of a wayward woman. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_25">  <sup>25</sup>Do not lust in your heart after her beauty <br/>   or let her captivate you with her eyes. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_26">  <sup>26</sup>For a prostitute can be had for a loaf of bread, <br/>   but another man’s wife preys on your very life. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_27">  <sup>27</sup>Can a man scoop fire into his lap <br/>   without his clothes being burned? <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_28">  <sup>28</sup>Can a man walk on hot coals <br/>   without his feet being scorched? <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_29">  <sup>29</sup>So is he who sleeps with another man’s wife; <br/>   no one who touches her will go unpunished. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_30">  <sup>30</sup>People do not despise a thief if he steals <br/>   to satisfy his hunger when he is starving. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_31">  <sup>31</sup>Yet if he is caught, he must pay sevenfold, <br/>   though it costs him all the wealth of his house. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_32">  <sup>32</sup>But a man who commits adultery has no sense; <br/>   whoever does so destroys himself. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_33">  <sup>33</sup>Blows and disgrace are his lot, <br/>   and his shame will never be wiped away. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_34">  <sup>34</sup>For jealousy arouses a husband’s fury, <br/>   and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_6_35">  <sup>35</sup>He will not accept any compensation; <br/>   he will refuse a bribe, however great it is. <br/></span>
