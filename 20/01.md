<span class="verse ch_1_3">  <sup>3</sup>for receiving instruction in prudent behavior, <br/>   doing what is right and just and fair; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_4">  <sup>4</sup>for giving prudence to those who are simple,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew word rendered simple in Proverbs denotes a person who is gullible, without moral direction and inclined to evil.">⚓</a><br/>   knowledge and discretion to the young— <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_5">  <sup>5</sup>let the wise listen and add to their learning, <br/>   and let the discerning get guidance— <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_6">  <sup>6</sup>for understanding proverbs and parables, <br/>   the sayings and riddles of the wise.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or understanding a proverb, namely, a parable, / and the sayings of the wise, their riddles">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_7">  <sup>7</sup>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, <br/>   but fools<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew words rendered fool in Proverbs, and often elsewhere in the Old Testament, denote a person who is morally deficient.">⚓</a> despise wisdom and instruction. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>Prologue: Exhortations to Embrace Wisdom </p><h3>Warning Against the Invitation of Sinful Men </h3></div>
<span class="verse ch_1_8">  <sup>8</sup>Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction <br/>   and do not forsake your mother’s teaching. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_9">  <sup>9</sup>They are a garland to grace your head <br/>   and a chain to adorn your neck. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_10">  <sup>10</sup>My son, if sinful men entice you, <br/>   do not give in to them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_11">  <sup>11</sup>If they say, “Come along with us; <br/>   let’s lie in wait for innocent blood, <br/>   let’s ambush some harmless soul; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_12">  <sup>12</sup>let’s swallow them alive, like the grave, <br/>   and whole, like those who go down to the pit; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_13">  <sup>13</sup>we will get all sorts of valuable things <br/>   and fill our houses with plunder; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_14">  <sup>14</sup>cast lots with us; <br/>   we will all share the loot”— <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_15">  <sup>15</sup>my son, do not go along with them, <br/>   do not set foot on their paths; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_16">  <sup>16</sup>for their feet rush into evil, <br/>   they are swift to shed blood. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_17">  <sup>17</sup>How useless to spread a net <br/>   where every bird can see it! <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_18">  <sup>18</sup>These men lie in wait for their own blood; <br/>   they ambush only themselves! <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_19">  <sup>19</sup>Such are the paths of all who go after ill-gotten gain; <br/>   it takes away the life of those who get it. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Wisdom’s Rebuke </h3></div>
<span class="verse ch_1_20">  <sup>20</sup>Out in the open wisdom calls aloud, <br/>   she raises her voice in the public square; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_21">  <sup>21</sup>on top of the wall<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint; Hebrew / at noisy street corners">⚓</a> she cries out, <br/>   at the city gate she makes her speech: <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_22">  <sup>22</sup>“How long will you who are simple love your simple ways? <br/>   How long will mockers delight in mockery <br/>   and fools hate knowledge? <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_23">  <sup>23</sup>Repent at my rebuke! <br/>   Then I will pour out my thoughts to you, <br/>   I will make known to you my teachings. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_24">  <sup>24</sup>But since you refuse to listen when I call <br/>   and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_25">  <sup>25</sup>since you disregard all my advice <br/>   and do not accept my rebuke, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_26">  <sup>26</sup>I in turn will laugh when disaster strikes you; <br/>   I will mock when calamity overtakes you— <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_27">  <sup>27</sup>when calamity overtakes you like a storm, <br/>   when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, <br/>   when distress and trouble overwhelm you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_28">  <sup>28</sup>“Then they will call to me but I will not answer; <br/>   they will look for me but will not find me, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_29">  <sup>29</sup>since they hated knowledge <br/>   and did not choose to fear the Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_30">  <sup>30</sup>Since they would not accept my advice <br/>   and spurned my rebuke, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_31">  <sup>31</sup>they will eat the fruit of their ways <br/>   and be filled with the fruit of their schemes. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_32">  <sup>32</sup>For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, <br/>   and the complacency of fools will destroy them; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_1_33">  <sup>33</sup>but whoever listens to me will live in safety <br/>   and be at ease, without fear of harm.” <br/></span>
