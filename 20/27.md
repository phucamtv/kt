<div class="title"><h1>27</h1></div>
<span class="verse ch_27_1">  <sup>1</sup>Do not boast about tomorrow, <br/>   for you do not know what a day may bring. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_2">  <sup>2</sup>Let someone else praise you, and not your own mouth; <br/>   an outsider, and not your own lips. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_3">  <sup>3</sup>Stone is heavy and sand a burden, <br/>   but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_4">  <sup>4</sup>Anger is cruel and fury overwhelming, <br/>   but who can stand before jealousy? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_5">  <sup>5</sup>Better is open rebuke <br/>   than hidden love. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_6">  <sup>6</sup>Wounds from a friend can be trusted, <br/>   but an enemy multiplies kisses. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_7">  <sup>7</sup>One who is full loathes honey from the comb, <br/>   but to the hungry even what is bitter tastes sweet. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_8">  <sup>8</sup>Like a bird that flees its nest <br/>   is anyone who flees from home. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_9">  <sup>9</sup>Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart, <br/>   and the pleasantness of a friend <br/>   springs from their heartfelt advice. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_10">  <sup>10</sup>Do not forsake your friend or a friend of your family, <br/>   and do not go to your relative’s house when disaster strikes you— <br/>   better a neighbor nearby than a relative far away. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_11">  <sup>11</sup>Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart; <br/>   then I can answer anyone who treats me with contempt. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_12">  <sup>12</sup>The prudent see danger and take refuge, <br/>   but the simple keep going and pay the penalty. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_13">  <sup>13</sup>Take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger; <br/>   hold it in pledge if it is done for an outsider. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_14">  <sup>14</sup>If anyone loudly blesses their neighbor early in the morning, <br/>   it will be taken as a curse. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_15">  <sup>15</sup>A quarrelsome wife is like the dripping <br/>   of a leaky roof in a rainstorm; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_16">  <sup>16</sup>restraining her is like restraining the wind <br/>   or grasping oil with the hand. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_17">  <sup>17</sup>As iron sharpens iron, <br/>   so one person sharpens another. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_18">  <sup>18</sup>The one who guards a fig tree will eat its fruit, <br/>   and whoever protects their master will be honored. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_19">  <sup>19</sup>As water reflects the face, <br/>   so one’s life reflects the heart.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or so others reflect your heart back to you">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_20">  <sup>20</sup>Death and Destruction<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew Abaddon">⚓</a> are never satisfied, <br/>   and neither are human eyes. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_21">  <sup>21</sup>The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, <br/>   but people are tested by their praise. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_22">  <sup>22</sup>Though you grind a fool in a mortar, <br/>   grinding them like grain with a pestle, <br/>   you will not remove their folly from them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_23">  <sup>23</sup>Be sure you know the condition of your flocks, <br/>   give careful attention to your herds; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_24">  <sup>24</sup>for riches do not endure forever, <br/>   and a crown is not secure for all generations. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_25">  <sup>25</sup>When the hay is removed and new growth appears <br/>   and the grass from the hills is gathered in, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_26">  <sup>26</sup>the lambs will provide you with clothing, <br/>   and the goats with the price of a field. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_27_27">  <sup>27</sup>You will have plenty of goats’ milk to feed your family <br/>   and to nourish your female servants. <br/><br/></span>
