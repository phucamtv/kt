<div class="title"><h1>25</h1><h3>More Proverbs of Solomon </h3></div>
<span class="verse ch_25_1"> <sup>1</sup>These are more proverbs of Solomon, compiled by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah: <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_2">  <sup>2</sup>It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; <br/>   to search out a matter is the glory of kings. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_3">  <sup>3</sup>As the heavens are high and the earth is deep, <br/>   so the hearts of kings are unsearchable. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_4">  <sup>4</sup>Remove the dross from the silver, <br/>   and a silversmith can produce a vessel; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_5">  <sup>5</sup>remove wicked officials from the king’s presence, <br/>   and his throne will be established through righteousness. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_6">  <sup>6</sup>Do not exalt yourself in the king’s presence, <br/>   and do not claim a place among his great men; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_7">  <sup>7</sup>it is better for him to say to you, “Come up here,” <br/>   than for him to humiliate you before his nobles. <br/><br/>  What you have seen with your eyes <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_8">   <sup>8</sup>do not bring<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or nobles  / on whom you had set your eyes.  / 8Do not go">⚓</a> hastily to court, <br/>  for what will you do in the end <br/>   if your neighbor puts you to shame? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_9">  <sup>9</sup>If you take your neighbor to court, <br/>   do not betray another’s confidence, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_10">  <sup>10</sup>or the one who hears it may shame you <br/>   and the charge against you will stand. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_11">  <sup>11</sup>Like apples<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or possibly apricots">⚓</a> of gold in settings of silver <br/>   is a ruling rightly given. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_12">  <sup>12</sup>Like an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold <br/>   is the rebuke of a wise judge to a listening ear. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_13">  <sup>13</sup>Like a snow-cooled drink at harvest time <br/>   is a trustworthy messenger to the one who sends him; <br/>   he refreshes the spirit of his master. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_14">  <sup>14</sup>Like clouds and wind without rain <br/>   is one who boasts of gifts never given. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_15">  <sup>15</sup>Through patience a ruler can be persuaded, <br/>   and a gentle tongue can break a bone. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_16">  <sup>16</sup>If you find honey, eat just enough— <br/>   too much of it, and you will vomit. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_17">  <sup>17</sup>Seldom set foot in your neighbor’s house— <br/>   too much of you, and they will hate you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_18">  <sup>18</sup>Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow <br/>   is one who gives false testimony against a neighbor. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_19">  <sup>19</sup>Like a broken tooth or a lame foot <br/>   is reliance on the unfaithful in a time of trouble. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_20">  <sup>20</sup>Like one who takes away a garment on a cold day, <br/>   or like vinegar poured on a wound, <br/>   is one who sings songs to a heavy heart. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_21">  <sup>21</sup>If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; <br/>   if he is thirsty, give him water to drink. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_22">  <sup>22</sup>In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, <br/>   and the Lord will reward you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_23">  <sup>23</sup>Like a north wind that brings unexpected rain <br/>   is a sly tongue—which provokes a horrified look. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_24">  <sup>24</sup>Better to live on a corner of the roof <br/>   than share a house with a quarrelsome wife. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_25">  <sup>25</sup>Like cold water to a weary soul <br/>   is good news from a distant land. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_26">  <sup>26</sup>Like a muddied spring or a polluted well <br/>   are the righteous who give way to the wicked. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_27">  <sup>27</sup>It is not good to eat too much honey, <br/>   nor is it honorable to search out matters that are too deep. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_25_28">  <sup>28</sup>Like a city whose walls are broken through <br/>   is a person who lacks self-control. <br/><br/></span>
