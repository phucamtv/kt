<span class="verse ch_28_1">  <sup>1</sup>The wicked flee though no one pursues, <br/>   but the righteous are as bold as a lion. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_2">  <sup>2</sup>When a country is rebellious, it has many rulers, <br/>   but a ruler with discernment and knowledge maintains order. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_3">  <sup>3</sup>A ruler<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or A poor person">⚓</a> who oppresses the poor <br/>   is like a driving rain that leaves no crops. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_4">  <sup>4</sup>Those who forsake instruction praise the wicked, <br/>   but those who heed it resist them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_5">  <sup>5</sup>Evildoers do not understand what is right, <br/>   but those who seek the Lord understand it fully. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_6">  <sup>6</sup>Better the poor whose walk is blameless <br/>   than the rich whose ways are perverse. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_7">  <sup>7</sup>A discerning son heeds instruction, <br/>   but a companion of gluttons disgraces his father. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_8">  <sup>8</sup>Whoever increases wealth by taking interest or profit from the poor <br/>   amasses it for another, who will be kind to the poor. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_9">  <sup>9</sup>If anyone turns a deaf ear to my instruction, <br/>   even their prayers are detestable. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_10">  <sup>10</sup>Whoever leads the upright along an evil path <br/>   will fall into their own trap, <br/>   but the blameless will receive a good inheritance. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_11">  <sup>11</sup>The rich are wise in their own eyes; <br/>   one who is poor and discerning sees how deluded they are. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_12">  <sup>12</sup>When the righteous triumph, there is great elation; <br/>   but when the wicked rise to power, people go into hiding. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_13">  <sup>13</sup>Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, <br/>   but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_14">  <sup>14</sup>Blessed is the one who always trembles before God, <br/>   but whoever hardens their heart falls into trouble. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_15">  <sup>15</sup>Like a roaring lion or a charging bear <br/>   is a wicked ruler over a helpless people. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_16">  <sup>16</sup>A tyrannical ruler practices extortion, <br/>   but one who hates ill-gotten gain will enjoy a long reign. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_17">  <sup>17</sup>Anyone tormented by the guilt of murder <br/>   will seek refuge in the grave; <br/>   let no one hold them back. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_18">  <sup>18</sup>The one whose walk is blameless is kept safe, <br/>   but the one whose ways are perverse will fall into the pit.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Syriac (see Septuagint); Hebrew into one">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_19">  <sup>19</sup>Those who work their land will have abundant food, <br/>   but those who chase fantasies will have their fill of poverty. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_20">  <sup>20</sup>A faithful person will be richly blessed, <br/>   but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_21">  <sup>21</sup>To show partiality is not good— <br/>   yet a person will do wrong for a piece of bread. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_22">  <sup>22</sup>The stingy are eager to get rich <br/>   and are unaware that poverty awaits them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_23">  <sup>23</sup>Whoever rebukes a person will in the end gain favor <br/>   rather than one who has a flattering tongue. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_24">  <sup>24</sup>Whoever robs their father or mother <br/>   and says, “It’s not wrong,” <br/>   is partner to one who destroys. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_25">  <sup>25</sup>The greedy stir up conflict, <br/>   but those who trust in the Lord will prosper. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_26">  <sup>26</sup>Those who trust in themselves are fools, <br/>   but those who walk in wisdom are kept safe. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_27">  <sup>27</sup>Those who give to the poor will lack nothing, <br/>   but those who close their eyes to them receive many curses. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_28_28">  <sup>28</sup>When the wicked rise to power, people go into hiding; <br/>   but when the wicked perish, the righteous thrive. <br/><br/></span>
