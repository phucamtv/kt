<div class="title"><h1>8</h1><h3>Wisdom’s Call </h3></div>
<span class="verse ch_8_1">  <sup>1</sup>Does not wisdom call out? <br/>   Does not understanding raise her voice? <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_2">  <sup>2</sup>At the highest point along the way, <br/>   where the paths meet, she takes her stand; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_3">  <sup>3</sup>beside the gate leading into the city, <br/>   at the entrance, she cries aloud: <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_4">  <sup>4</sup>“To you, O people, I call out; <br/>   I raise my voice to all mankind. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_5">  <sup>5</sup>You who are simple, gain prudence; <br/>   you who are foolish, set your hearts on it.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint; Hebrew foolish, instruct your minds">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_6">  <sup>6</sup>Listen, for I have trustworthy things to say; <br/>   I open my lips to speak what is right. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_7">  <sup>7</sup>My mouth speaks what is true, <br/>   for my lips detest wickedness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_8">  <sup>8</sup>All the words of my mouth are just; <br/>   none of them is crooked or perverse. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_9">  <sup>9</sup>To the discerning all of them are right; <br/>   they are upright to those who have found knowledge. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_10">  <sup>10</sup>Choose my instruction instead of silver, <br/>   knowledge rather than choice gold, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_11">  <sup>11</sup>for wisdom is more precious than rubies, <br/>   and nothing you desire can compare with her. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_12">  <sup>12</sup>“I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence; <br/>   I possess knowledge and discretion. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_13">  <sup>13</sup>To fear the Lord is to hate evil; <br/>   I hate pride and arrogance, <br/>   evil behavior and perverse speech. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_14">  <sup>14</sup>Counsel and sound judgment are mine; <br/>   I have insight, I have power. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_15">  <sup>15</sup>By me kings reign <br/>   and rulers issue decrees that are just; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_16">  <sup>16</sup>by me princes govern, <br/>   and nobles—all who rule on earth.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some Hebrew manuscripts and Septuagint; other Hebrew manuscripts all righteous rulers">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_17">  <sup>17</sup>I love those who love me, <br/>   and those who seek me find me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_18">  <sup>18</sup>With me are riches and honor, <br/>   enduring wealth and prosperity. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_19">  <sup>19</sup>My fruit is better than fine gold; <br/>   what I yield surpasses choice silver. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_20">  <sup>20</sup>I walk in the way of righteousness, <br/>   along the paths of justice, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_21">  <sup>21</sup>bestowing a rich inheritance on those who love me <br/>   and making their treasuries full. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_22">  <sup>22</sup>“The Lord brought me forth as the first of his works,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or way ; or dominion">⚓</a><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or The Lordpossessed me at the beginning of his work ; or The Lordbrought me forth at the beginning of his work">⚓</a><br/>   before his deeds of old; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_23">  <sup>23</sup>I was formed long ages ago, <br/>   at the very beginning, when the world came to be. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_24">  <sup>24</sup>When there were no watery depths, I was given birth, <br/>   when there were no springs overflowing with water; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_25">  <sup>25</sup>before the mountains were settled in place, <br/>   before the hills, I was given birth, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_26">  <sup>26</sup>before he made the world or its fields <br/>   or any of the dust of the earth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_27">  <sup>27</sup>I was there when he set the heavens in place, <br/>   when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_28">  <sup>28</sup>when he established the clouds above <br/>   and fixed securely the fountains of the deep, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_29">  <sup>29</sup>when he gave the sea its boundary <br/>   so the waters would not overstep his command, <br/>  and when he marked out the foundations of the earth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_30">   <sup>30</sup>Then I was constantly<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or was the artisan ; or was a little child">⚓</a> at his side. <br/>  I was filled with delight day after day, <br/>   rejoicing always in his presence, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_31">  <sup>31</sup>rejoicing in his whole world <br/>   and delighting in mankind. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_32">  <sup>32</sup>“Now then, my children, listen to me; <br/>   blessed are those who keep my ways. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_33">  <sup>33</sup>Listen to my instruction and be wise; <br/>   do not disregard it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_34">  <sup>34</sup>Blessed are those who listen to me, <br/>   watching daily at my doors, <br/>   waiting at my doorway. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_35">  <sup>35</sup>For those who find me find life <br/>   and receive favor from the Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_8_36">  <sup>36</sup>But those who fail to find me harm themselves; <br/>   all who hate me love death.” <br/></span>
