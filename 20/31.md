<span class="verse ch_31_1"> <sup>1</sup>The sayings of King Lemuel—an inspired utterance his mother taught him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_31_2">  <sup>2</sup>Listen, my son! Listen, son of my womb! <br/>   Listen, my son, the answer to my prayers! <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_31_3">  <sup>3</sup>Do not spend your strength<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or wealth">⚓</a> on women, <br/>   your vigor on those who ruin kings. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_31_4">  <sup>4</sup>It is not for kings, Lemuel— <br/>   it is not for kings to drink wine, <br/>   not for rulers to crave beer, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_31_5">  <sup>5</sup>lest they drink and forget what has been decreed, <br/>   and deprive all the oppressed of their rights. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_31_6">  <sup>6</sup>Let beer be for those who are perishing, <br/>   wine for those who are in anguish! <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_31_7">  <sup>7</sup>Let them drink and forget their poverty <br/>   and remember their misery no more. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_31_8">  <sup>8</sup>Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, <br/>   for the rights of all who are destitute. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_31_9">  <sup>9</sup>Speak up and judge fairly; <br/>   defend the rights of the poor and needy. <br/></span>

<span class="verse ch_31_12">  <sup>12</sup>She brings him good, not harm, <br/>   all the days of her life. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_31_13">  <sup>13</sup>She selects wool and flax <br/>   and works with eager hands. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_31_14">  <sup>14</sup>She is like the merchant ships, <br/>   bringing her food from afar. <br/></span>

<span class="verse ch_31_22">  <sup>22</sup>She makes coverings for her bed; <br/>   she is clothed in fine linen and purple. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_31_23">  <sup>23</sup>Her husband is respected at the city gate, <br/>   where he takes his seat among the elders of the land. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_31_24">  <sup>24</sup>She makes linen garments and sells them, <br/>   and supplies the merchants with sashes. <br/></span>

<span class="verse ch_31_29">  <sup>29</sup>“Many women do noble things, <br/>   but you surpass them all.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_31_30">  <sup>30</sup>Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; <br/>   but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ch_31_31">  <sup>31</sup>Honor her for all that her hands have done, <br/>   and let her works bring her praise at the city gate. <br/></span>
