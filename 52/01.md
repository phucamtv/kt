<div class="title"><h3>Thanksgiving for the Thessalonians’ Faith </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1te_1_2"> <sup>2</sup>We always thank God for all of you and continually mention you in our prayers. </span>
<span class="verse 1te_1_3"><sup>3</sup>We remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1te_1_4"> <sup>4</sup>For we know, brothers and sisters<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek word for brothers and sisters (adelphoi ) refers here to believers, both men and women, as part of God’s family; also in 2:1, 9, 14, 17; 3:7; 4:1, 10, 13; 5:1, 4, 12, 14, 25, 27.">⚓</a> loved by God, that he has chosen you, </span>
<span class="verse 1te_1_5"><sup>5</sup>because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with power, with the Holy Spirit and deep conviction. You know how we lived among you for your sake. </span>
<span class="verse 1te_1_6"><sup>6</sup>You became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you welcomed the message in the midst of severe suffering with the joy given by the Holy Spirit. </span>
<span class="verse 1te_1_7"><sup>7</sup>And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. </span>
<span class="verse 1te_1_8"><sup>8</sup>The Lord’s message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia—your faith in God has become known everywhere. Therefore we do not need to say anything about it, </span>
<span class="verse 1te_1_9"><sup>9</sup>for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, </span>
<span class="verse 1te_1_10"><sup>10</sup>and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead—Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath. <br/></span>
