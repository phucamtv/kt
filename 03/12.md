<div class="title"><h1>12</h1><h3>Purification After Childbirth </h3></div>
<span class="verse le_12_1"> <sup>1</sup>The Lord said to Moses, </span>
<span class="verse le_12_2"><sup>2</sup>“Say to the Israelites: ‘A woman who becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son will be ceremonially unclean for seven days, just as she is unclean during her monthly period. </span>
<span class="verse le_12_3"><sup>3</sup>On the eighth day the boy is to be circumcised. </span>
<span class="verse le_12_4"><sup>4</sup>Then the woman must wait thirty-three days to be purified from her bleeding. She must not touch anything sacred or go to the sanctuary until the days of her purification are over. </span>
<span class="verse le_12_5"><sup>5</sup>If she gives birth to a daughter, for two weeks the woman will be unclean, as during her period. Then she must wait sixty-six days to be purified from her bleeding. <br/></span>
<span class="verse le_12_6"> <sup>6</sup>“ ‘When the days of her purification for a son or daughter are over, she is to bring to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a dove for a sin offering.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or purification offering ; also in verse 8">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse le_12_7"><sup>7</sup>He shall offer them before the Lord to make atonement for her, and then she will be ceremonially clean from her flow of blood. <br/> “ ‘These are the regulations for the woman who gives birth to a boy or a girl. </span>
<span class="verse le_12_8"><sup>8</sup>But if she cannot afford a lamb, she is to bring two doves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for her, and she will be clean.’ ” <br/></span>
