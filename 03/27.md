<div class="title"><h1>27</h1><h3>Redeeming What Is the Lord’s </h3></div>
<span class="verse le_27_1"> <sup>1</sup>The Lord said to Moses, </span>
<span class="verse le_27_2"><sup>2</sup>“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘If anyone makes a special vow to dedicate a person to the Lord by giving the equivalent value, </span>
<span class="verse le_27_3"><sup>3</sup>set the value of a male between the ages of twenty and sixty at fifty shekels<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 1 1/4 pounds or about 575 grams; also in verse 16">⚓</a> of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 2/5 ounce or about 12 grams; also in verse 25">⚓</a> ; </span>
<span class="verse le_27_4"><sup>4</sup>for a female, set her value at thirty shekels<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 12 ounces or about 345 grams">⚓</a> ; </span>
<span class="verse le_27_5"><sup>5</sup>for a person between the ages of five and twenty, set the value of a male at twenty shekels<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 8 ounces or about 230 grams">⚓</a> and of a female at ten shekels<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 4 ounces or about 115 grams; also in verse 7">⚓</a> ; </span>
<span class="verse le_27_6"><sup>6</sup>for a person between one month and five years, set the value of a male at five shekels<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 2 ounces or about 58 grams">⚓</a> of silver and that of a female at three shekels<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 1 1/4 ounces or about 35 grams">⚓</a> of silver; </span>
<span class="verse le_27_7"><sup>7</sup>for a person sixty years old or more, set the value of a male at fifteen shekels<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 6 ounces or about 175 grams">⚓</a> and of a female at ten shekels. </span>
<span class="verse le_27_8"><sup>8</sup>If anyone making the vow is too poor to pay the specified amount, the person being dedicated is to be presented to the priest, who will set the value according to what the one making the vow can afford. <br/></span>
<span class="verse le_27_9"> <sup>9</sup>“ ‘If what they vowed is an animal that is acceptable as an offering to the Lord, such an animal given to the Lord becomes holy. </span>
<span class="verse le_27_10"><sup>10</sup>They must not exchange it or substitute a good one for a bad one, or a bad one for a good one; if they should substitute one animal for another, both it and the substitute become holy. </span>
<span class="verse le_27_11"><sup>11</sup>If what they vowed is a ceremonially unclean animal—one that is not acceptable as an offering to the Lord—the animal must be presented to the priest, </span>
<span class="verse le_27_12"><sup>12</sup>who will judge its quality as good or bad. Whatever value the priest then sets, that is what it will be. </span>
<span class="verse le_27_13"><sup>13</sup>If the owner wishes to redeem the animal, a fifth must be added to its value. <br/></span>
<span class="verse le_27_14"> <sup>14</sup>“ ‘If anyone dedicates their house as something holy to the Lord, the priest will judge its quality as good or bad. Whatever value the priest then sets, so it will remain. </span>
<span class="verse le_27_15"><sup>15</sup>If the one who dedicates their house wishes to redeem it, they must add a fifth to its value, and the house will again become theirs. <br/></span>
<span class="verse le_27_16"> <sup>16</sup>“ ‘If anyone dedicates to the Lord part of their family land, its value is to be set according to the amount of seed required for it—fifty shekels of silver to a homer<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, probably about 300 pounds or about 135 kilograms">⚓</a> of barley seed. </span>
<span class="verse le_27_17"><sup>17</sup>If they dedicate a field during the Year of Jubilee, the value that has been set remains. </span>
<span class="verse le_27_18"><sup>18</sup>But if they dedicate a field after the Jubilee, the priest will determine the value according to the number of years that remain until the next Year of Jubilee, and its set value will be reduced. </span>
<span class="verse le_27_19"><sup>19</sup>If the one who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, they must add a fifth to its value, and the field will again become theirs. </span>
<span class="verse le_27_20"><sup>20</sup>If, however, they do not redeem the field, or if they have sold it to someone else, it can never be redeemed. </span>
<span class="verse le_27_21"><sup>21</sup>When the field is released in the Jubilee, it will become holy, like a field devoted to the Lord; it will become priestly property. <br/></span>
<span class="verse le_27_22"> <sup>22</sup>“ ‘If anyone dedicates to the Lord a field they have bought, which is not part of their family land, </span>
<span class="verse le_27_23"><sup>23</sup>the priest will determine its value up to the Year of Jubilee, and the owner must pay its value on that day as something holy to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse le_27_24"><sup>24</sup>In the Year of Jubilee the field will revert to the person from whom it was bought, the one whose land it was. </span>
<span class="verse le_27_25"><sup>25</sup>Every value is to be set according to the sanctuary shekel, twenty gerahs to the shekel. <br/></span>
<span class="verse le_27_26"> <sup>26</sup>“ ‘No one, however, may dedicate the firstborn of an animal, since the firstborn already belongs to the Lord; whether an ox<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew word can refer to either male or female.">⚓</a> or a sheep, it is the Lord’s. </span>
<span class="verse le_27_27"><sup>27</sup>If it is one of the unclean animals, it may be bought back at its set value, adding a fifth of the value to it. If it is not redeemed, it is to be sold at its set value. <br/></span>
<span class="verse le_27_28"> <sup>28</sup>“ ‘But nothing that a person owns and devotes<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew term refers to the irrevocable giving over of things or persons to the Lord.">⚓</a> to the Lord—whether a human being or an animal or family land—may be sold or redeemed; everything so devoted is most holy to the Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse le_27_29"> <sup>29</sup>“ ‘No person devoted to destruction<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew term refers to the irrevocable giving over of things or persons to the Lord, often by totally destroying them.">⚓</a> may be ransomed; they are to be put to death. <br/></span>
<span class="verse le_27_30"> <sup>30</sup>“ ‘A tithe of everything from the land, whether grain from the soil or fruit from the trees, belongs to the Lord; it is holy to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse le_27_31"><sup>31</sup>Whoever would redeem any of their tithe must add a fifth of the value to it. </span>
<span class="verse le_27_32"><sup>32</sup>Every tithe of the herd and flock—every tenth animal that passes under the shepherd’s rod—will be holy to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse le_27_33"><sup>33</sup>No one may pick out the good from the bad or make any substitution. If anyone does make a substitution, both the animal and its substitute become holy and cannot be redeemed.’ ” <br/></span>
<span class="verse le_27_34"> <sup>34</sup>These are the commands the Lord gave Moses at Mount Sinai for the Israelites. <br/></span>
