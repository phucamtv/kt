<div class="title"><h1>3</h1></div>
<span class="verse nha_3_1">  <sup>1</sup>All night long on my bed <br/>   I looked for the one my heart loves; <br/>   I looked for him but did not find him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_3_2">  <sup>2</sup>I will get up now and go about the city, <br/>   through its streets and squares; <br/>  I will search for the one my heart loves. <br/>   So I looked for him but did not find him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_3_3">  <sup>3</sup>The watchmen found me <br/>   as they made their rounds in the city. <br/>   “Have you seen the one my heart loves?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_3_4">  <sup>4</sup>Scarcely had I passed them <br/>   when I found the one my heart loves. <br/>  I held him and would not let him go <br/>   till I had brought him to my mother’s house, <br/>   to the room of the one who conceived me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_3_5">  <sup>5</sup>Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you <br/>   by the gazelles and by the does of the field: <br/>  Do not arouse or awaken love <br/>   until it so desires. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_3_6">  <sup>6</sup>Who is this coming up from the wilderness <br/>   like a column of smoke, <br/>  perfumed with myrrh and incense <br/>   made from all the spices of the merchant? <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_3_7">  <sup>7</sup>Look! It is Solomon’s carriage, <br/>   escorted by sixty warriors, <br/>   the noblest of Israel, <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_3_8">  <sup>8</sup>all of them wearing the sword, <br/>   all experienced in battle, <br/>  each with his sword at his side, <br/>   prepared for the terrors of the night. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_3_9">  <sup>9</sup>King Solomon made for himself the carriage; <br/>   he made it of wood from Lebanon. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_3_10">  <sup>10</sup>Its posts he made of silver, <br/>   its base of gold. <br/>  Its seat was upholstered with purple, <br/>   its interior inlaid with love. <br/>  Daughters of Jerusalem, </span>
<span class="verse nha_3_11">  <sup>11</sup>come out, <br/>   and look, you daughters of Zion. <br/>  Look<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or interior lovingly inlaid / by the daughters of Jerusalem. / 11Come out, you daughters of Zion, / and look">⚓</a> on King Solomon wearing a crown, <br/>   the crown with which his mother crowned him <br/>  on the day of his wedding, <br/>   the day his heart rejoiced. <br/></span>
