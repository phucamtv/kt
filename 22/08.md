<span class="verse nha_8_1">  <sup>1</sup>If only you were to me like a brother, <br/>   who was nursed at my mother’s breasts! <br/>  Then, if I found you outside, <br/>   I would kiss you, <br/>   and no one would despise me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_8_2">  <sup>2</sup>I would lead you <br/>   and bring you to my mother’s house— <br/>   she who has taught me. <br/>  I would give you spiced wine to drink, <br/>   the nectar of my pomegranates. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_8_3">  <sup>3</sup>His left arm is under my head <br/>   and his right arm embraces me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_8_4">  <sup>4</sup>Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you: <br/>   Do not arouse or awaken love <br/>   until it so desires. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>Friends </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_8_5">  <sup>5</sup>Who is this coming up from the wilderness <br/>   leaning on her beloved? <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>She </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_8_5">  Under the apple tree I roused you; <br/>   there your mother conceived you, <br/>   there she who was in labor gave you birth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_8_6">  <sup>6</sup>Place me like a seal over your heart, <br/>   like a seal on your arm; <br/>  for love is as strong as death, <br/>   its jealousy<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or ardor">⚓</a> unyielding as the grave. <br/>  It burns like blazing fire, <br/>   like a mighty flame.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or fire, / like the very flame of the Lord">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_8_7">  <sup>7</sup>Many waters cannot quench love; <br/>   rivers cannot sweep it away. <br/>  If one were to give <br/>   all the wealth of one’s house for love, <br/>   it<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or he">⚓</a> would be utterly scorned. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>Friends </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_8_8">  <sup>8</sup>We have a little sister, <br/>   and her breasts are not yet grown. <br/>  What shall we do for our sister <br/>   on the day she is spoken for? <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_8_9">  <sup>9</sup>If she is a wall, <br/>   we will build towers of silver on her. <br/>  If she is a door, <br/>   we will enclose her with panels of cedar. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>She </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_8_10">  <sup>10</sup>I am a wall, <br/>   and my breasts are like towers. <br/>  Thus I have become in his eyes <br/>   like one bringing contentment. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_8_11">  <sup>11</sup>Solomon had a vineyard in Baal Hamon; <br/>   he let out his vineyard to tenants. <br/>  Each was to bring for its fruit <br/>   a thousand shekels<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 25 pounds or about 12 kilograms; also in verse 12">⚓</a> of silver. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_8_12">  <sup>12</sup>But my own vineyard is mine to give; <br/>   the thousand shekels are for you, Solomon, <br/>   and two hundred<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 5 pounds or about 2.3 kilograms">⚓</a> are for those who tend its fruit. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>He </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_8_13">  <sup>13</sup>You who dwell in the gardens <br/>   with friends in attendance, <br/>   let me hear your voice! <br/></span>
