<span class="verse nha_1_2">  <sup>2</sup>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth— <br/>   for your love is more delightful than wine. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_1_3">  <sup>3</sup>Pleasing is the fragrance of your perfumes; <br/>   your name is like perfume poured out. <br/>   No wonder the young women love you! <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_1_4">  <sup>4</sup>Take me away with you—let us hurry! <br/>   Let the king bring me into his chambers. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>Friends </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_1_4">  We rejoice and delight in you<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew is masculine singular.">⚓</a> ; <br/>   we will praise your love more than wine. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>She </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_1_4">  How right they are to adore you! <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_1_5">  <sup>5</sup>Dark am I, yet lovely, <br/>   daughters of Jerusalem, <br/>  dark like the tents of Kedar, <br/>   like the tent curtains of Solomon.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Salma">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_1_6">  <sup>6</sup>Do not stare at me because I am dark, <br/>   because I am darkened by the sun. <br/>  My mother’s sons were angry with me <br/>   and made me take care of the vineyards; <br/>   my own vineyard I had to neglect. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_1_7">  <sup>7</sup>Tell me, you whom I love, <br/>   where you graze your flock <br/>   and where you rest your sheep at midday. <br/>  Why should I be like a veiled woman <br/>   beside the flocks of your friends? <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>Friends </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_1_8">  <sup>8</sup>If you do not know, most beautiful of women, <br/>   follow the tracks of the sheep <br/>  and graze your young goats <br/>   by the tents of the shepherds. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>He </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_1_9">  <sup>9</sup>I liken you, my darling, to a mare <br/>   among Pharaoh’s chariot horses. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_1_10">  <sup>10</sup>Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings, <br/>   your neck with strings of jewels. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_1_11">  <sup>11</sup>We will make you earrings of gold, <br/>   studded with silver. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>She </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_1_12">  <sup>12</sup>While the king was at his table, <br/>   my perfume spread its fragrance. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_1_13">  <sup>13</sup>My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh <br/>   resting between my breasts. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_1_14">  <sup>14</sup>My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms <br/>   from the vineyards of En Gedi. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>He </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_1_15">  <sup>15</sup>How beautiful you are, my darling! <br/>   Oh, how beautiful! <br/>   Your eyes are doves. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>She </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_1_16">  <sup>16</sup>How handsome you are, my beloved! <br/>   Oh, how charming! <br/>   And our bed is verdant. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>He </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_1_17">  <sup>17</sup>The beams of our house are cedars; <br/>   our rafters are firs. <br/></span>
