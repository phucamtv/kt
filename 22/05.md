<span class="verse nha_5_1">  <sup>1</sup>I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; <br/>   I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. <br/>  I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey; <br/>   I have drunk my wine and my milk. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>Friends </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_5_1">  Eat, friends, and drink; <br/>   drink your fill of love. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>She </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_5_2">  <sup>2</sup>I slept but my heart was awake. <br/>   Listen! My beloved is knocking: <br/>  “Open to me, my sister, my darling, <br/>   my dove, my flawless one. <br/>  My head is drenched with dew, <br/>   my hair with the dampness of the night.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_5_3">  <sup>3</sup>I have taken off my robe— <br/>   must I put it on again? <br/>  I have washed my feet— <br/>   must I soil them again? <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_5_4">  <sup>4</sup>My beloved thrust his hand through the latch-opening; <br/>   my heart began to pound for him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_5_5">  <sup>5</sup>I arose to open for my beloved, <br/>   and my hands dripped with myrrh, <br/>  my fingers with flowing myrrh, <br/>   on the handles of the bolt. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_5_6">  <sup>6</sup>I opened for my beloved, <br/>   but my beloved had left; he was gone. <br/>   My heart sank at his departure.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or heart had gone out to him when he spoke">⚓</a><br/>  I looked for him but did not find him. <br/>   I called him but he did not answer. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_5_7">  <sup>7</sup>The watchmen found me <br/>   as they made their rounds in the city. <br/>  They beat me, they bruised me; <br/>   they took away my cloak, <br/>   those watchmen of the walls! <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_5_8">  <sup>8</sup>Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you— <br/>   if you find my beloved, <br/>  what will you tell him? <br/>   Tell him I am faint with love. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>Friends </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_5_9">  <sup>9</sup>How is your beloved better than others, <br/>   most beautiful of women? <br/>  How is your beloved better than others, <br/>   that you so charge us? <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>She </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_5_10">  <sup>10</sup>My beloved is radiant and ruddy, <br/>   outstanding among ten thousand. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_5_11">  <sup>11</sup>His head is purest gold; <br/>   his hair is wavy <br/>   and black as a raven. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_5_12">  <sup>12</sup>His eyes are like doves <br/>   by the water streams, <br/>  washed in milk, <br/>   mounted like jewels. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_5_13">  <sup>13</sup>His cheeks are like beds of spice <br/>   yielding perfume. <br/>  His lips are like lilies <br/>   dripping with myrrh. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_5_14">  <sup>14</sup>His arms are rods of gold <br/>   set with topaz. <br/>  His body is like polished ivory <br/>   decorated with lapis lazuli. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_5_15">  <sup>15</sup>His legs are pillars of marble <br/>   set on bases of pure gold. <br/>  His appearance is like Lebanon, <br/>   choice as its cedars. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_5_16">  <sup>16</sup>His mouth is sweetness itself; <br/>   he is altogether lovely. <br/>  This is my beloved, this is my friend, <br/>   daughters of Jerusalem. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>Friends </p></div>
