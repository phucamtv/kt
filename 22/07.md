<div class="title"><h1>7</h1></div>
<span class="verse nha_7_1">  <sup>1</sup>How beautiful your sandaled feet, <br/>   O prince’s daughter! <br/>  Your graceful legs are like jewels, <br/>   the work of an artist’s hands. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_7_2">  <sup>2</sup>Your navel is a rounded goblet <br/>   that never lacks blended wine. <br/>  Your waist is a mound of wheat <br/>   encircled by lilies. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_7_3">  <sup>3</sup>Your breasts are like two fawns, <br/>   like twin fawns of a gazelle. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_7_4">  <sup>4</sup>Your neck is like an ivory tower. <br/>  Your eyes are the pools of Heshbon <br/>   by the gate of Bath Rabbim. <br/>  Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon <br/>   looking toward Damascus. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_7_5">  <sup>5</sup>Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel. <br/>   Your hair is like royal tapestry; <br/>   the king is held captive by its tresses. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_7_6">  <sup>6</sup>How beautiful you are and how pleasing, <br/>   my love, with your delights! <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_7_7">  <sup>7</sup>Your stature is like that of the palm, <br/>   and your breasts like clusters of fruit. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_7_8">  <sup>8</sup>I said, “I will climb the palm tree; <br/>   I will take hold of its fruit.” <br/>  May your breasts be like clusters of grapes on the vine, <br/>   the fragrance of your breath like apples, <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_7_9">   <sup>9</sup>and your mouth like the best wine. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>She </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_7_9">  May the wine go straight to my beloved, <br/>   flowing gently over lips and teeth.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint, Aquila, Vulgate and Syriac; Hebrew lips of sleepers">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_7_10">  <sup>10</sup>I belong to my beloved, <br/>   and his desire is for me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_7_11">  <sup>11</sup>Come, my beloved, let us go to the countryside, <br/>   let us spend the night in the villages.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or the henna bushes">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_7_12">  <sup>12</sup>Let us go early to the vineyards <br/>   to see if the vines have budded, <br/>  if their blossoms have opened, <br/>   and if the pomegranates are in bloom— <br/>   there I will give you my love. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_7_13">  <sup>13</sup>The mandrakes send out their fragrance, <br/>   and at our door is every delicacy, <br/>  both new and old, <br/>   that I have stored up for you, my beloved. <br/><br/></span>
