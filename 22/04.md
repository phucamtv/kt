<span class="verse nha_4_1">  <sup>1</sup>How beautiful you are, my darling! <br/>   Oh, how beautiful! <br/>   Your eyes behind your veil are doves. <br/>  Your hair is like a flock of goats <br/>   descending from the hills of Gilead. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_4_2">  <sup>2</sup>Your teeth are like a flock of sheep just shorn, <br/>   coming up from the washing. <br/>  Each has its twin; <br/>   not one of them is alone. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_4_3">  <sup>3</sup>Your lips are like a scarlet ribbon; <br/>   your mouth is lovely. <br/>  Your temples behind your veil <br/>   are like the halves of a pomegranate. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_4_4">  <sup>4</sup>Your neck is like the tower of David, <br/>   built with courses of stone<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this phrase is uncertain.">⚓</a> ; <br/>  on it hang a thousand shields, <br/>   all of them shields of warriors. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_4_5">  <sup>5</sup>Your breasts are like two fawns, <br/>   like twin fawns of a gazelle <br/>   that browse among the lilies. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_4_6">  <sup>6</sup>Until the day breaks <br/>   and the shadows flee, <br/>  I will go to the mountain of myrrh <br/>   and to the hill of incense. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_4_7">  <sup>7</sup>You are altogether beautiful, my darling; <br/>   there is no flaw in you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_4_8">  <sup>8</sup>Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, <br/>   come with me from Lebanon. <br/>  Descend from the crest of Amana, <br/>   from the top of Senir, the summit of Hermon, <br/>  from the lions’ dens <br/>   and the mountain haunts of leopards. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_4_9">  <sup>9</sup>You have stolen my heart, my sister, my bride; <br/>   you have stolen my heart <br/>  with one glance of your eyes, <br/>   with one jewel of your necklace. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_4_10">  <sup>10</sup>How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride! <br/>   How much more pleasing is your love than wine, <br/>  and the fragrance of your perfume <br/>   more than any spice! <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_4_11">  <sup>11</sup>Your lips drop sweetness as the honeycomb, my bride; <br/>   milk and honey are under your tongue. <br/>  The fragrance of your garments <br/>   is like the fragrance of Lebanon. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_4_12">  <sup>12</sup>You are a garden locked up, my sister, my bride; <br/>   you are a spring enclosed, a sealed fountain. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_4_13">  <sup>13</sup>Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates <br/>   with choice fruits, <br/>   with henna and nard, <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_4_14">   <sup>14</sup>nard and saffron, <br/>   calamus and cinnamon, <br/>   with every kind of incense tree, <br/>   with myrrh and aloes <br/>   and all the finest spices. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_4_15">  <sup>15</sup>You are<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or I am (spoken by She )">⚓</a> a garden fountain, <br/>   a well of flowing water <br/>   streaming down from Lebanon. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>She </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_4_16">  <sup>16</sup>Awake, north wind, <br/>   and come, south wind! <br/>  Blow on my garden, <br/>   that its fragrance may spread everywhere. <br/>  Let my beloved come into his garden <br/>   and taste its choice fruits. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>He </p></div>
