<span class="verse nha_6_2">  <sup>2</sup>My beloved has gone down to his garden, <br/>   to the beds of spices, <br/>  to browse in the gardens <br/>   and to gather lilies. <br/></span>

<span class="verse nha_6_4">  <sup>4</sup>You are as beautiful as Tirzah, my darling, <br/>   as lovely as Jerusalem, <br/>   as majestic as troops with banners. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_6_5">  <sup>5</sup>Turn your eyes from me; <br/>   they overwhelm me. <br/>  Your hair is like a flock of goats <br/>   descending from Gilead. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_6_6">  <sup>6</sup>Your teeth are like a flock of sheep <br/>   coming up from the washing. <br/>  Each has its twin, <br/>   not one of them is missing. <br/></span>

<span class="verse nha_6_9">  <sup>9</sup>but my dove, my perfect one, is unique, <br/>   the only daughter of her mother, <br/>   the favorite of the one who bore her. <br/>  The young women saw her and called her blessed; <br/>   the queens and concubines praised her. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>Friends </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_6_10">  <sup>10</sup>Who is this that appears like the dawn, <br/>   fair as the moon, bright as the sun, <br/>   majestic as the stars in procession? <br/></span>
<div class="title"><p>He </p></div>
<span class="verse nha_6_11">  <sup>11</sup>I went down to the grove of nut trees <br/>   to look at the new growth in the valley, <br/>  to see if the vines had budded <br/>   or the pomegranates were in bloom. <br/></span>
<span class="verse nha_6_12">  <sup>12</sup>Before I realized it, <br/>   my desire set me among the royal chariots of my people.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or among the chariots of Amminadab ; or among the chariots of the people of the prince">⚓</a><br/></span>
