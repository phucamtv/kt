<span class="verse es_52_1">  <sup>1</sup>Awake, awake, Zion, <br/>   clothe yourself with strength! <br/>  Put on your garments of splendor, <br/>   Jerusalem, the holy city. <br/>  The uncircumcised and defiled <br/>   will not enter you again. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_52_2">  <sup>2</sup>Shake off your dust; <br/>   rise up, sit enthroned, Jerusalem. <br/>  Free yourself from the chains on your neck, <br/>   Daughter Zion, now a captive. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_52_3"> <sup>3</sup>For this is what the Lord says: <br/>  “You were sold for nothing, <br/>   and without money you will be redeemed.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_52_4"> <sup>4</sup>For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: <br/>  “At first my people went down to Egypt to live; <br/>   lately, Assyria has oppressed them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_52_5"> <sup>5</sup>“And now what do I have here?” declares the Lord. <br/>  “For my people have been taken away for nothing, <br/>   and those who rule them mock,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dead Sea Scrolls and Vulgate; Masoretic Text wail">⚓</a> ” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/><br/>  “And all day long <br/>   my name is constantly blasphemed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_52_6">  <sup>6</sup>Therefore my people will know my name; <br/>   therefore in that day they will know <br/>  that it is I who foretold it. <br/>   Yes, it is I.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_52_7">  <sup>7</sup>How beautiful on the mountains <br/>   are the feet of those who bring good news, <br/>  who proclaim peace, <br/>   who bring good tidings, <br/>   who proclaim salvation, <br/>  who say to Zion, <br/>   “Your God reigns!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_52_8">  <sup>8</sup>Listen! Your watchmen lift up their voices; <br/>   together they shout for joy. <br/>  When the Lord returns to Zion, <br/>   they will see it with their own eyes. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_52_9">  <sup>9</sup>Burst into songs of joy together, <br/>   you ruins of Jerusalem, <br/>  for the Lord has comforted his people, <br/>   he has redeemed Jerusalem. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_52_10">  <sup>10</sup>The Lord will lay bare his holy arm <br/>   in the sight of all the nations, <br/>  and all the ends of the earth will see <br/>   the salvation of our God. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_52_11">  <sup>11</sup>Depart, depart, go out from there! <br/>   Touch no unclean thing! <br/>  Come out from it and be pure, <br/>   you who carry the articles of the Lord’s house. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_52_12">  <sup>12</sup>But you will not leave in haste <br/>   or go in flight; <br/>  for the Lord will go before you, <br/>   the God of Israel will be your rear guard. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Suffering and Glory of the Servant </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_52_13">  <sup>13</sup>See, my servant will act wisely<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or will prosper">⚓</a> ; <br/>   he will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_52_14">  <sup>14</sup>Just as there were many who were appalled at him<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew you">⚓</a> — <br/>   his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any human being <br/>   and his form marred beyond human likeness— <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_52_15">  <sup>15</sup>so he will sprinkle many nations,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or so will many nations be amazed at him (see also Septuagint)">⚓</a><br/>   and kings will shut their mouths because of him. <br/>  For what they were not told, they will see, <br/>   and what they have not heard, they will understand. <br/><br/></span>
