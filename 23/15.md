<div class="title"><h1>15</h1><h3>A Prophecy Against Moab </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_15_1"> <sup>1</sup>A prophecy against Moab: <br/>  Ar in Moab is ruined, <br/>   destroyed in a night! <br/>  Kir in Moab is ruined, <br/>   destroyed in a night! <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_15_2">  <sup>2</sup>Dibon goes up to its temple, <br/>   to its high places to weep; <br/>   Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba. <br/>  Every head is shaved <br/>   and every beard cut off. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_15_3">  <sup>3</sup>In the streets they wear sackcloth; <br/>   on the roofs and in the public squares <br/>  they all wail, <br/>   prostrate with weeping. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_15_4">  <sup>4</sup>Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, <br/>   their voices are heard all the way to Jahaz. <br/>  Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out, <br/>   and their hearts are faint. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_15_5">  <sup>5</sup>My heart cries out over Moab; <br/>   her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, <br/>   as far as Eglath Shelishiyah. <br/>  They go up the hill to Luhith, <br/>   weeping as they go; <br/>  on the road to Horonaim <br/>   they lament their destruction. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_15_6">  <sup>6</sup>The waters of Nimrim are dried up <br/>   and the grass is withered; <br/>  the vegetation is gone <br/>   and nothing green is left. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_15_7">  <sup>7</sup>So the wealth they have acquired and stored up <br/>   they carry away over the Ravine of the Poplars. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_15_8">  <sup>8</sup>Their outcry echoes along the border of Moab; <br/>   their wailing reaches as far as Eglaim, <br/>   their lamentation as far as Beer Elim. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_15_9">  <sup>9</sup>The waters of Dimon<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=", a wordplay on Dibon (see verse 2), sounds like the Hebrew for blood .">⚓</a> are full of blood, <br/>   but I will bring still more upon Dimon<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=", a wordplay on Dibon (see verse 2), sounds like the Hebrew for blood .">⚓</a> — <br/>  a lion upon the fugitives of Moab <br/>   and upon those who remain in the land. <br/><br/></span>
