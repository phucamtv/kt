<div class="title"><h1>20</h1><h3>A Prophecy Against Egypt and Cush </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_20_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the year that the supreme commander, sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and attacked and captured it— </span>
<span class="verse es_20_2"><sup>2</sup>at that time the Lord spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz. He said to him, “Take off the sackcloth from your body and the sandals from your feet.” And he did so, going around stripped and barefoot. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_20_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then the Lord said, “Just as my servant Isaiah has gone stripped and barefoot for three years, as a sign and portent against Egypt and Cush,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, the upper Nile region; also in verse 5">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse es_20_4"><sup>4</sup>so the king of Assyria will lead away stripped and barefoot the Egyptian captives and Cushite exiles, young and old, with buttocks bared—to Egypt’s shame. </span>
<span class="verse es_20_5"><sup>5</sup>Those who trusted in Cush and boasted in Egypt will be dismayed and put to shame. </span>
<span class="verse es_20_6"><sup>6</sup>In that day the people who live on this coast will say, ‘See what has happened to those we relied on, those we fled to for help and deliverance from the king of Assyria! How then can we escape?’ ” <br/></span>
