<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>Isaiah’s Commission </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord, high and exalted, seated on a throne; and the train of his robe filled the temple. </span>
<span class="verse es_6_2"><sup>2</sup>Above him were seraphim, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying. </span>
<span class="verse es_6_3"><sup>3</sup>And they were calling to one another: <br/>  “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty; <br/>   the whole earth is full of his glory.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_6_4"> <sup>4</sup>At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_6_5"> <sup>5</sup>“Woe to me!” I cried. “I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord Almighty.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_6_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar. </span>
<span class="verse es_6_7"><sup>7</sup>With it he touched my mouth and said, “See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_6_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?” <br/> And I said, “Here am I. Send me!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_6_9"> <sup>9</sup>He said, “Go and tell this people: <br/>  “ ‘Be ever hearing, but never understanding; <br/>   be ever seeing, but never perceiving.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_6_10">  <sup>10</sup>Make the heart of this people calloused; <br/>   make their ears dull <br/>   and close their eyes.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew; Septuagint ‘You will be ever hearing, but never understanding; / you will be ever seeing, but never perceiving.’ / 10This people’s heart has become calloused; / they hardly hear with their ears, / and they have closed their eyes">⚓</a><br/>  Otherwise they might see with their eyes, <br/>   hear with their ears, <br/>   understand with their hearts, <br/>  and turn and be healed.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_6_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then I said, “For how long, Lord?” <br/> And he answered: <br/>  “Until the cities lie ruined <br/>   and without inhabitant, <br/>  until the houses are left deserted <br/>   and the fields ruined and ravaged, <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_6_12">  <sup>12</sup>until the Lord has sent everyone far away <br/>   and the land is utterly forsaken. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_6_13">  <sup>13</sup>And though a tenth remains in the land, <br/>   it will again be laid waste. <br/>  But as the terebinth and oak <br/>   leave stumps when they are cut down, <br/>   so the holy seed will be the stump in the land.” <br/></span>
