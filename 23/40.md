<div class="title"><h1>40</h1><h3>Comfort for God’s People </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_40_1">  <sup>1</sup>Comfort, comfort my people, <br/>   says your God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_2">  <sup>2</sup>Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, <br/>   and proclaim to her <br/>  that her hard service has been completed, <br/>   that her sin has been paid for, <br/>  that she has received from the Lord’s hand <br/>   double for all her sins. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_3">  <sup>3</sup>A voice of one calling: <br/>  “In the wilderness prepare <br/>   the way for the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or A voice of one calling in the wilderness: / “Prepare the way for the Lord">⚓</a> ; <br/>  make straight in the desert <br/>   a highway for our God.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew; Septuagint make straight the paths of our God">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_4">  <sup>4</sup>Every valley shall be raised up, <br/>   every mountain and hill made low; <br/>  the rough ground shall become level, <br/>   the rugged places a plain. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_5">  <sup>5</sup>And the glory of the Lord will be revealed, <br/>   and all people will see it together. <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.” </aside><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_6">  <sup>6</sup>A voice says, “Cry out.” <br/>   And I said, “What shall I cry?” <br/><br/>  “All people are like grass, <br/>   and all their faithfulness is like the flowers of the field. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_7">  <sup>7</sup>The grass withers and the flowers fall, <br/>   because the breath of the Lord blows on them. <br/>   Surely the people are grass. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_8">  <sup>8</sup>The grass withers and the flowers fall, <br/>   but the word of our God endures forever.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_9">  <sup>9</sup>You who bring good news to Zion, <br/>   go up on a high mountain. <br/>  You who bring good news to Jerusalem,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Zion, bringer of good news, / go up on a high mountain. / Jerusalem, bringer of good news">⚓</a><br/>   lift up your voice with a shout, <br/>  lift it up, do not be afraid; <br/>   say to the towns of Judah, <br/>   “Here is your God!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_10">  <sup>10</sup>See, the Sovereign Lord comes with power, <br/>   and he rules with a mighty arm. <br/>  See, his reward is with him, <br/>   and his recompense accompanies him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_11">  <sup>11</sup>He tends his flock like a shepherd: <br/>   He gathers the lambs in his arms <br/>  and carries them close to his heart; <br/>   he gently leads those that have young. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_12">  <sup>12</sup>Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, <br/>   or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens? <br/>  Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket, <br/>   or weighed the mountains on the scales <br/>   and the hills in a balance? <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_13">  <sup>13</sup>Who can fathom the Spirit<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or mind">⚓</a> of the Lord, <br/>   or instruct the Lord as his counselor? <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_14">  <sup>14</sup>Whom did the Lord consult to enlighten him, <br/>   and who taught him the right way? <br/>  Who was it that taught him knowledge, <br/>   or showed him the path of understanding? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_15">  <sup>15</sup>Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket; <br/>   they are regarded as dust on the scales; <br/>   he weighs the islands as though they were fine dust. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_16">  <sup>16</sup>Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires, <br/>   nor its animals enough for burnt offerings. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_17">  <sup>17</sup>Before him all the nations are as nothing; <br/>   they are regarded by him as worthless <br/>   and less than nothing. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_18">  <sup>18</sup>With whom, then, will you compare God? <br/>   To what image will you liken him? <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_19">  <sup>19</sup>As for an idol, a metalworker casts it, <br/>   and a goldsmith overlays it with gold <br/>   and fashions silver chains for it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_20">  <sup>20</sup>A person too poor to present such an offering <br/>   selects wood that will not rot; <br/>  they look for a skilled worker <br/>   to set up an idol that will not topple. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_21">  <sup>21</sup>Do you not know? <br/>   Have you not heard? <br/>  Has it not been told you from the beginning? <br/>   Have you not understood since the earth was founded? <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_22">  <sup>22</sup>He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, <br/>   and its people are like grasshoppers. <br/>  He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, <br/>   and spreads them out like a tent to live in. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_23">  <sup>23</sup>He brings princes to naught <br/>   and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_24">  <sup>24</sup>No sooner are they planted, <br/>   no sooner are they sown, <br/>   no sooner do they take root in the ground, <br/>  than he blows on them and they wither, <br/>   and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_25">  <sup>25</sup>“To whom will you compare me? <br/>   Or who is my equal?” says the Holy One. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_26">  <sup>26</sup>Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens: <br/>   Who created all these? <br/>  He who brings out the starry host one by one <br/>   and calls forth each of them by name. <br/>  Because of his great power and mighty strength, <br/>   not one of them is missing. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_27">  <sup>27</sup>Why do you complain, Jacob? <br/>   Why do you say, Israel, <br/>  “My way is hidden from the Lord; <br/>   my cause is disregarded by my God”? <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_28">  <sup>28</sup>Do you not know? <br/>   Have you not heard? <br/>  The Lord is the everlasting God, <br/>   the Creator of the ends of the earth. <br/>  He will not grow tired or weary, <br/>   and his understanding no one can fathom. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_29">  <sup>29</sup>He gives strength to the weary <br/>   and increases the power of the weak. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_30">  <sup>30</sup>Even youths grow tired and weary, <br/>   and young men stumble and fall; <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_40_31">  <sup>31</sup>but those who hope in the Lord<br/>   will renew their strength. <br/>  They will soar on wings like eagles; <br/>   they will run and not grow weary, <br/>   they will walk and not be faint. <br/></span>
