<div class="title"><h1>27</h1><h3>Deliverance of Israel </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_27_1"> <sup>1</sup>In that day, <br/>  the Lord will punish with his sword— <br/>   his fierce, great and powerful sword— <br/>  Leviathan the gliding serpent, <br/>   Leviathan the coiling serpent; <br/>  he will slay the monster of the sea. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_27_2"> <sup>2</sup>In that day— <br/>  “Sing about a fruitful vineyard: <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_27_3">   <sup>3</sup>I, the Lord, watch over it; <br/>   I water it continually. <br/>  I guard it day and night <br/>   so that no one may harm it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_27_4">   <sup>4</sup>I am not angry. <br/>  If only there were briers and thorns confronting me! <br/>   I would march against them in battle; <br/>   I would set them all on fire. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_27_5">  <sup>5</sup>Or else let them come to me for refuge; <br/>   let them make peace with me, <br/>   yes, let them make peace with me.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_27_6">  <sup>6</sup>In days to come Jacob will take root, <br/>   Israel will bud and blossom <br/>   and fill all the world with fruit. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_27_7">  <sup>7</sup>Has the Lord struck her <br/>   as he struck down those who struck her? <br/>  Has she been killed <br/>   as those were killed who killed her? <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_27_8">  <sup>8</sup>By warfare<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="See Septuagint; the meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.">⚓</a> and exile you contend with her— <br/>   with his fierce blast he drives her out, <br/>   as on a day the east wind blows. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_27_9">  <sup>9</sup>By this, then, will Jacob’s guilt be atoned for, <br/>   and this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin: <br/>  When he makes all the altar stones <br/>   to be like limestone crushed to pieces, <br/>  no Asherah poles<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, wooden symbols of the goddess Asherah">⚓</a> or incense altars <br/>   will be left standing. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_27_10">  <sup>10</sup>The fortified city stands desolate, <br/>   an abandoned settlement, forsaken like the wilderness; <br/>  there the calves graze, <br/>   there they lie down; <br/>   they strip its branches bare. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_27_11">  <sup>11</sup>When its twigs are dry, they are broken off <br/>   and women come and make fires with them. <br/>  For this is a people without understanding; <br/>   so their Maker has no compassion on them, <br/>   and their Creator shows them no favor. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_27_12"> <sup>12</sup>In that day the Lord will thresh from the flowing Euphrates to the Wadi of Egypt, and you, Israel, will be gathered up one by one. </span>
<span class="verse es_27_13"><sup>13</sup>And in that day a great trumpet will sound. Those who were perishing in Assyria and those who were exiled in Egypt will come and worship the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem. <br/></span>
