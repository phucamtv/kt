<div class="title"><h1>63</h1><h3>God’s Day of Vengeance and Redemption </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_63_1">  <sup>1</sup>Who is this coming from Edom, <br/>   from Bozrah, with his garments stained crimson? <br/>  Who is this, robed in splendor, <br/>   striding forward in the greatness of his strength? <br/><br/>  “It is I, proclaiming victory, <br/>   mighty to save.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_63_2">  <sup>2</sup>Why are your garments red, <br/>   like those of one treading the winepress? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_63_3">  <sup>3</sup>“I have trodden the winepress alone; <br/>   from the nations no one was with me. <br/>  I trampled them in my anger <br/>   and trod them down in my wrath; <br/>  their blood spattered my garments, <br/>   and I stained all my clothing. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_63_4">  <sup>4</sup>It was for me the day of vengeance; <br/>   the year for me to redeem had come. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_63_5">  <sup>5</sup>I looked, but there was no one to help, <br/>   I was appalled that no one gave support; <br/>  so my own arm achieved salvation for me, <br/>   and my own wrath sustained me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_63_6">  <sup>6</sup>I trampled the nations in my anger; <br/>   in my wrath I made them drunk <br/>   and poured their blood on the ground.” <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Praise and Prayer </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_63_7">  <sup>7</sup>I will tell of the kindnesses of the Lord, <br/>   the deeds for which he is to be praised, <br/>   according to all the Lord has done for us— <br/>  yes, the many good things <br/>   he has done for Israel, <br/>   according to his compassion and many kindnesses. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_63_8">  <sup>8</sup>He said, “Surely they are my people, <br/>   children who will be true to me”; <br/>   and so he became their Savior. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_63_9">  <sup>9</sup>In all their distress he too was distressed, <br/>   and the angel of his presence saved them.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Savior 9in their distress. / It was no envoy or angel / but his own presence that saved them">⚓</a><br/>  In his love and mercy he redeemed them; <br/>   he lifted them up and carried them <br/>   all the days of old. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_63_10">  <sup>10</sup>Yet they rebelled <br/>   and grieved his Holy Spirit. <br/>  So he turned and became their enemy <br/>   and he himself fought against them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_63_11">  <sup>11</sup>Then his people recalled<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or But may he recall">⚓</a> the days of old, <br/>   the days of Moses and his people— <br/>  where is he who brought them through the sea, <br/>   with the shepherd of his flock? <br/>  Where is he who set <br/>   his Holy Spirit among them, <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_63_12">  <sup>12</sup>who sent his glorious arm of power <br/>   to be at Moses’ right hand, <br/>  who divided the waters before them, <br/>   to gain for himself everlasting renown, <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_63_13">  <sup>13</sup>who led them through the depths? <br/>  Like a horse in open country, <br/>   they did not stumble; <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_63_14">  <sup>14</sup>like cattle that go down to the plain, <br/>   they were given rest by the Spirit of the Lord. <br/>  This is how you guided your people <br/>   to make for yourself a glorious name. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_63_15">  <sup>15</sup>Look down from heaven and see, <br/>   from your lofty throne, holy and glorious. <br/>  Where are your zeal and your might? <br/>   Your tenderness and compassion are withheld from us. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_63_16">  <sup>16</sup>But you are our Father, <br/>   though Abraham does not know us <br/>   or Israel acknowledge us; <br/>  you, Lord, are our Father, <br/>   our Redeemer from of old is your name. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_63_17">  <sup>17</sup>Why, Lord, do you make us wander from your ways <br/>   and harden our hearts so we do not revere you? <br/>  Return for the sake of your servants, <br/>   the tribes that are your inheritance. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_63_18">  <sup>18</sup>For a little while your people possessed your holy place, <br/>   but now our enemies have trampled down your sanctuary. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_63_19">  <sup>19</sup>We are yours from of old; <br/>   but you have not ruled over them, <br/>   they have not been called<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or We are like those you have never ruled, / like those never called">⚓</a> by your name. <br/><br/></span>
