<span class="verse es_64_1">  <sup>1</sup>Oh, that you would rend the heavens and come down, <br/>   that the mountains would tremble before you! <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_64_2">  <sup>2</sup>As when fire sets twigs ablaze <br/>   and causes water to boil, <br/>  come down to make your name known to your enemies <br/>   and cause the nations to quake before you! <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_64_3">  <sup>3</sup>For when you did awesome things that we did not expect, <br/>   you came down, and the mountains trembled before you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_64_4">  <sup>4</sup>Since ancient times no one has heard, <br/>   no ear has perceived, <br/>  no eye has seen any God besides you, <br/>   who acts on behalf of those who wait for him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_64_5">  <sup>5</sup>You come to the help of those who gladly do right, <br/>   who remember your ways. <br/>  But when we continued to sin against them, <br/>   you were angry. <br/>   How then can we be saved? <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_64_6">  <sup>6</sup>All of us have become like one who is unclean, <br/>   and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; <br/>  we all shrivel up like a leaf, <br/>   and like the wind our sins sweep us away. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_64_7">  <sup>7</sup>No one calls on your name <br/>   or strives to lay hold of you; <br/>  for you have hidden your face from us <br/>   and have given us over to<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint, Syriac and Targum; Hebrew have made us melt because of">⚓</a> our sins. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_64_8">  <sup>8</sup>Yet you, Lord, are our Father. <br/>   We are the clay, you are the potter; <br/>   we are all the work of your hand. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_64_9">  <sup>9</sup>Do not be angry beyond measure, Lord; <br/>   do not remember our sins forever. <br/>  Oh, look on us, we pray, <br/>   for we are all your people. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_64_10">  <sup>10</sup>Your sacred cities have become a wasteland; <br/>   even Zion is a wasteland, Jerusalem a desolation. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_64_11">  <sup>11</sup>Our holy and glorious temple, where our ancestors praised you, <br/>   has been burned with fire, <br/>   and all that we treasured lies in ruins. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_64_12">  <sup>12</sup>After all this, Lord, will you hold yourself back? <br/>   Will you keep silent and punish us beyond measure? <br/></span>
