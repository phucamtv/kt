<div class="title"><h1>18</h1><h3>A Prophecy Against Cush </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_18_1">  <sup>1</sup>Woe to the land of whirring wings<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or of locusts">⚓</a><br/>   along the rivers of Cush,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, the upper Nile region">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_18_2">  <sup>2</sup>which sends envoys by sea <br/>   in papyrus boats over the water. <br/><br/>  Go, swift messengers, <br/>  to a people tall and smooth-skinned, <br/>   to a people feared far and wide, <br/>  an aggressive nation of strange speech, <br/>   whose land is divided by rivers. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_18_3">  <sup>3</sup>All you people of the world, <br/>   you who live on the earth, <br/>  when a banner is raised on the mountains, <br/>   you will see it, <br/>  and when a trumpet sounds, <br/>   you will hear it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_18_4">  <sup>4</sup>This is what the Lord says to me: <br/>   “I will remain quiet and will look on from my dwelling place, <br/>  like shimmering heat in the sunshine, <br/>   like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_18_5">  <sup>5</sup>For, before the harvest, when the blossom is gone <br/>   and the flower becomes a ripening grape, <br/>  he will cut off the shoots with pruning knives, <br/>   and cut down and take away the spreading branches. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_18_6">  <sup>6</sup>They will all be left to the mountain birds of prey <br/>   and to the wild animals; <br/>  the birds will feed on them all summer, <br/>   the wild animals all winter. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_18_7"> <sup>7</sup>At that time gifts will be brought to the Lord Almighty <br/>  from a people tall and smooth-skinned, <br/>   from a people feared far and wide, <br/>  an aggressive nation of strange speech, <br/>   whose land is divided by rivers— <br/> the gifts will be brought to Mount Zion, the place of the Name of the Lord Almighty. <br/></span>
