<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>The Mountain of the Lord </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem: <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_2"> <sup>2</sup>In the last days <br/>  the mountain of the Lord’s temple will be established <br/>   as the highest of the mountains; <br/>  it will be exalted above the hills, <br/>   and all nations will stream to it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_3"> <sup>3</sup>Many peoples will come and say, <br/>  “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, <br/>   to the temple of the God of Jacob. <br/>  He will teach us his ways, <br/>   so that we may walk in his paths.” <br/>  The law will go out from Zion, <br/>   the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_4">  <sup>4</sup>He will judge between the nations <br/>   and will settle disputes for many peoples. <br/>  They will beat their swords into plowshares <br/>   and their spears into pruning hooks. <br/>  Nation will not take up sword against nation, <br/>   nor will they train for war anymore. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_5">  <sup>5</sup>Come, descendants of Jacob, <br/>   let us walk in the light of the Lord. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Day of the Lord </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_2_6">  <sup>6</sup>You, Lord, have abandoned your people, <br/>   the descendants of Jacob. <br/>  They are full of superstitions from the East; <br/>   they practice divination like the Philistines <br/>   and embrace pagan customs. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_7">  <sup>7</sup>Their land is full of silver and gold; <br/>   there is no end to their treasures. <br/>  Their land is full of horses; <br/>   there is no end to their chariots. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_8">  <sup>8</sup>Their land is full of idols; <br/>   they bow down to the work of their hands, <br/>   to what their fingers have made. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_9">  <sup>9</sup>So people will be brought low <br/>   and everyone humbled— <br/>   do not forgive them.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or not raise them up">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_10">  <sup>10</sup>Go into the rocks, hide in the ground <br/>   from the fearful presence of the Lord<br/>   and the splendor of his majesty! <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_11">  <sup>11</sup>The eyes of the arrogant will be humbled <br/>   and human pride brought low; <br/>  the Lord alone will be exalted in that day. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_12">  <sup>12</sup>The Lord Almighty has a day in store <br/>   for all the proud and lofty, <br/>  for all that is exalted <br/>   (and they will be humbled), <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_13">  <sup>13</sup>for all the cedars of Lebanon, tall and lofty, <br/>   and all the oaks of Bashan, <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_14">  <sup>14</sup>for all the towering mountains <br/>   and all the high hills, <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_15">  <sup>15</sup>for every lofty tower <br/>   and every fortified wall, <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_16">  <sup>16</sup>for every trading ship<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew every ship of Tarshish">⚓</a><br/>   and every stately vessel. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_17">  <sup>17</sup>The arrogance of man will be brought low <br/>   and human pride humbled; <br/>  the Lord alone will be exalted in that day, <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_18">   <sup>18</sup>and the idols will totally disappear. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_19">  <sup>19</sup>People will flee to caves in the rocks <br/>   and to holes in the ground <br/>  from the fearful presence of the Lord<br/>   and the splendor of his majesty, <br/>   when he rises to shake the earth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_20">  <sup>20</sup>In that day people will throw away <br/>   to the moles and bats <br/>  their idols of silver and idols of gold, <br/>   which they made to worship. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_21">  <sup>21</sup>They will flee to caverns in the rocks <br/>   and to the overhanging crags <br/>  from the fearful presence of the Lord<br/>   and the splendor of his majesty, <br/>   when he rises to shake the earth. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_2_22">  <sup>22</sup>Stop trusting in mere humans, <br/>   who have but a breath in their nostrils. <br/>   Why hold them in esteem? <br/></span>
