<div class="title"><h1>26</h1><h3>A Song of Praise </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_26_1"> <sup>1</sup>In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: <br/>  We have a strong city; <br/>   God makes salvation <br/>   its walls and ramparts. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_2">  <sup>2</sup>Open the gates <br/>   that the righteous nation may enter, <br/>   the nation that keeps faith. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_3">  <sup>3</sup>You will keep in perfect peace <br/>   those whose minds are steadfast, <br/>   because they trust in you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_4">  <sup>4</sup>Trust in the Lord forever, <br/>   for the Lord, the Lord himself, is the Rock eternal. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_5">  <sup>5</sup>He humbles those who dwell on high, <br/>   he lays the lofty city low; <br/>  he levels it to the ground <br/>   and casts it down to the dust. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_6">  <sup>6</sup>Feet trample it down— <br/>   the feet of the oppressed, <br/>   the footsteps of the poor. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_7">  <sup>7</sup>The path of the righteous is level; <br/>   you, the Upright One, make the way of the righteous smooth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_8">  <sup>8</sup>Yes, Lord, walking in the way of your laws,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or judgments">⚓</a><br/>   we wait for you; <br/>  your name and renown <br/>   are the desire of our hearts. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_9">  <sup>9</sup>My soul yearns for you in the night; <br/>   in the morning my spirit longs for you. <br/>  When your judgments come upon the earth, <br/>   the people of the world learn righteousness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_10">  <sup>10</sup>But when grace is shown to the wicked, <br/>   they do not learn righteousness; <br/>  even in a land of uprightness they go on doing evil <br/>   and do not regard the majesty of the Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_11">  <sup>11</sup>Lord, your hand is lifted high, <br/>   but they do not see it. <br/>  Let them see your zeal for your people and be put to shame; <br/>   let the fire reserved for your enemies consume them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_12">  <sup>12</sup>Lord, you establish peace for us; <br/>   all that we have accomplished you have done for us. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_13">  <sup>13</sup>Lord our God, other lords besides you have ruled over us, <br/>   but your name alone do we honor. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_14">  <sup>14</sup>They are now dead, they live no more; <br/>   their spirits do not rise. <br/>  You punished them and brought them to ruin; <br/>   you wiped out all memory of them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_15">  <sup>15</sup>You have enlarged the nation, Lord; <br/>   you have enlarged the nation. <br/>  You have gained glory for yourself; <br/>   you have extended all the borders of the land. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_16">  <sup>16</sup>Lord, they came to you in their distress; <br/>   when you disciplined them, <br/>   they could barely whisper a prayer.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this clause is uncertain.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_17">  <sup>17</sup>As a pregnant woman about to give birth <br/>   writhes and cries out in her pain, <br/>   so were we in your presence, Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_18">  <sup>18</sup>We were with child, we writhed in labor, <br/>   but we gave birth to wind. <br/>  We have not brought salvation to the earth, <br/>   and the people of the world have not come to life. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_19">  <sup>19</sup>But your dead will live, Lord; <br/>   their bodies will rise— <br/>  let those who dwell in the dust <br/>   wake up and shout for joy— <br/>  your dew is like the dew of the morning; <br/>   the earth will give birth to her dead. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_20">  <sup>20</sup>Go, my people, enter your rooms <br/>   and shut the doors behind you; <br/>  hide yourselves for a little while <br/>   until his wrath has passed by. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_26_21">  <sup>21</sup>See, the Lord is coming out of his dwelling <br/>   to punish the people of the earth for their sins. <br/>  The earth will disclose the blood shed on it; <br/>   the earth will conceal its slain no longer. <br/></span>
