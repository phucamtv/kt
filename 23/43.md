<div class="title"><h1>43</h1><h3>Israel’s Only Savior </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_43_1">  <sup>1</sup>But now, this is what the Lord says— <br/>   he who created you, Jacob, <br/>   he who formed you, Israel: <br/>  “Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; <br/>   I have summoned you by name; you are mine. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_2">  <sup>2</sup>When you pass through the waters, <br/>   I will be with you; <br/>  and when you pass through the rivers, <br/>   they will not sweep over you. <br/>  When you walk through the fire, <br/>   you will not be burned; <br/>   the flames will not set you ablaze. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_3">  <sup>3</sup>For I am the Lord your God, <br/>   the Holy One of Israel, your Savior; <br/>  I give Egypt for your ransom, <br/>   Cush<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, the upper Nile region">⚓</a> and Seba in your stead. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_4">  <sup>4</sup>Since you are precious and honored in my sight, <br/>   and because I love you, <br/>  I will give people in exchange for you, <br/>   nations in exchange for your life. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_5">  <sup>5</sup>Do not be afraid, for I am with you; <br/>   I will bring your children from the east <br/>   and gather you from the west. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_6">  <sup>6</sup>I will say to the north, ‘Give them up!’ <br/>   and to the south, ‘Do not hold them back.’ <br/>  Bring my sons from afar <br/>   and my daughters from the ends of the earth— <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_7">  <sup>7</sup>everyone who is called by my name, <br/>   whom I created for my glory, <br/>   whom I formed and made.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_8">  <sup>8</sup>Lead out those who have eyes but are blind, <br/>   who have ears but are deaf. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_9">  <sup>9</sup>All the nations gather together <br/>   and the peoples assemble. <br/>  Which of their gods foretold this <br/>   and proclaimed to us the former things? <br/>  Let them bring in their witnesses to prove they were right, <br/>   so that others may hear and say, “It is true.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_10">  <sup>10</sup>“You are my witnesses,” declares the Lord, <br/>   “and my servant whom I have chosen, <br/>  so that you may know and believe me <br/>   and understand that I am he. <br/>  Before me no god was formed, <br/>   nor will there be one after me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_11">  <sup>11</sup>I, even I, am the Lord, <br/>   and apart from me there is no savior. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_12">  <sup>12</sup>I have revealed and saved and proclaimed— <br/>   I, and not some foreign god among you. <br/>  You are my witnesses,” declares the Lord, “that I am God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_13">   <sup>13</sup>Yes, and from ancient days I am he. <br/>  No one can deliver out of my hand. <br/>   When I act, who can reverse it?” <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>God’s Mercy and Israel’s Unfaithfulness </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_43_14">  <sup>14</sup>This is what the Lord says— <br/>   your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: <br/>  “For your sake I will send to Babylon <br/>   and bring down as fugitives all the Babylonians,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Chaldeans">⚓</a><br/>   in the ships in which they took pride. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_15">  <sup>15</sup>I am the Lord, your Holy One, <br/>   Israel’s Creator, your King.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_16">  <sup>16</sup>This is what the Lord says— <br/>   he who made a way through the sea, <br/>   a path through the mighty waters, <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_17">  <sup>17</sup>who drew out the chariots and horses, <br/>   the army and reinforcements together, <br/>  and they lay there, never to rise again, <br/>   extinguished, snuffed out like a wick: <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_18">  <sup>18</sup>“Forget the former things; <br/>   do not dwell on the past. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_19">  <sup>19</sup>See, I am doing a new thing! <br/>   Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? <br/>  I am making a way in the wilderness <br/>   and streams in the wasteland. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_20">  <sup>20</sup>The wild animals honor me, <br/>   the jackals and the owls, <br/>  because I provide water in the wilderness <br/>   and streams in the wasteland, <br/>  to give drink to my people, my chosen, <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_21">   <sup>21</sup>the people I formed for myself <br/>   that they may proclaim my praise. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_22">  <sup>22</sup>“Yet you have not called on me, Jacob, <br/>   you have not wearied yourselves for<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Jacob; / surely you have grown weary of">⚓</a> me, Israel. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_23">  <sup>23</sup>You have not brought me sheep for burnt offerings, <br/>   nor honored me with your sacrifices. <br/>  I have not burdened you with grain offerings <br/>   nor wearied you with demands for incense. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_24">  <sup>24</sup>You have not bought any fragrant calamus for me, <br/>   or lavished on me the fat of your sacrifices. <br/>  But you have burdened me with your sins <br/>   and wearied me with your offenses. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_25">  <sup>25</sup>“I, even I, am he who blots out <br/>   your transgressions, for my own sake, <br/>   and remembers your sins no more. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_26">  <sup>26</sup>Review the past for me, <br/>   let us argue the matter together; <br/>   state the case for your innocence. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_27">  <sup>27</sup>Your first father sinned; <br/>   those I sent to teach you rebelled against me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_43_28">  <sup>28</sup>So I disgraced the dignitaries of your temple; <br/>   I consigned Jacob to destruction<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew term refers to the irrevocable giving over of things or persons to the Lord, often by totally destroying them.">⚓</a><br/>   and Israel to scorn. <br/></span>
