<div class="title"><h1>24</h1><h3>The Lord’s Devastation of the Earth </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_24_1">  <sup>1</sup>See, the Lord is going to lay waste the earth <br/>   and devastate it; <br/>  he will ruin its face <br/>   and scatter its inhabitants— <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_2">  <sup>2</sup>it will be the same <br/>   for priest as for people, <br/>   for the master as for his servant, <br/>   for the mistress as for her servant, <br/>   for seller as for buyer, <br/>   for borrower as for lender, <br/>   for debtor as for creditor. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_3">  <sup>3</sup>The earth will be completely laid waste <br/>   and totally plundered. <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">The Lord has spoken this word. </aside><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_4">  <sup>4</sup>The earth dries up and withers, <br/>   the world languishes and withers, <br/>   the heavens languish with the earth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_5">  <sup>5</sup>The earth is defiled by its people; <br/>   they have disobeyed the laws, <br/>  violated the statutes <br/>   and broken the everlasting covenant. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_6">  <sup>6</sup>Therefore a curse consumes the earth; <br/>   its people must bear their guilt. <br/>  Therefore earth’s inhabitants are burned up, <br/>   and very few are left. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_7">  <sup>7</sup>The new wine dries up and the vine withers; <br/>   all the merrymakers groan. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_8">  <sup>8</sup>The joyful timbrels are stilled, <br/>   the noise of the revelers has stopped, <br/>   the joyful harp is silent. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_9">  <sup>9</sup>No longer do they drink wine with a song; <br/>   the beer is bitter to its drinkers. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_10">  <sup>10</sup>The ruined city lies desolate; <br/>   the entrance to every house is barred. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_11">  <sup>11</sup>In the streets they cry out for wine; <br/>   all joy turns to gloom, <br/>   all joyful sounds are banished from the earth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_12">  <sup>12</sup>The city is left in ruins, <br/>   its gate is battered to pieces. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_13">  <sup>13</sup>So will it be on the earth <br/>   and among the nations, <br/>  as when an olive tree is beaten, <br/>   or as when gleanings are left after the grape harvest. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_14">  <sup>14</sup>They raise their voices, they shout for joy; <br/>   from the west they acclaim the Lord’s majesty. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_15">  <sup>15</sup>Therefore in the east give glory to the Lord; <br/>   exalt the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, <br/>   in the islands of the sea. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_16">  <sup>16</sup>From the ends of the earth we hear singing: <br/>   “Glory to the Righteous One.” <br/><br/>  But I said, “I waste away, I waste away! <br/>   Woe to me! <br/>  The treacherous betray! <br/>   With treachery the treacherous betray!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_17">  <sup>17</sup>Terror and pit and snare await you, <br/>   people of the earth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_18">  <sup>18</sup>Whoever flees at the sound of terror <br/>   will fall into a pit; <br/>  whoever climbs out of the pit <br/>   will be caught in a snare. <br/><br/>  The floodgates of the heavens are opened, <br/>   the foundations of the earth shake. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_19">  <sup>19</sup>The earth is broken up, <br/>   the earth is split asunder, <br/>   the earth is violently shaken. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_20">  <sup>20</sup>The earth reels like a drunkard, <br/>   it sways like a hut in the wind; <br/>  so heavy upon it is the guilt of its rebellion <br/>   that it falls—never to rise again. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_21">  <sup>21</sup>In that day the Lord will punish <br/>   the powers in the heavens above <br/>   and the kings on the earth below. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_22">  <sup>22</sup>They will be herded together <br/>   like prisoners bound in a dungeon; <br/>  they will be shut up in prison <br/>   and be punished<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or released">⚓</a> after many days. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_24_23">  <sup>23</sup>The moon will be dismayed, <br/>   the sun ashamed; <br/>  for the Lord Almighty will reign <br/>   on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, <br/>   and before its elders—with great glory. <br/></span>
