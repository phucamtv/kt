<div class="title"><h1>62</h1><h3>Zion’s New Name </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_62_1">  <sup>1</sup>For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent, <br/>   for Jerusalem’s sake I will not remain quiet, <br/>  till her vindication shines out like the dawn, <br/>   her salvation like a blazing torch. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_62_2">  <sup>2</sup>The nations will see your vindication, <br/>   and all kings your glory; <br/>  you will be called by a new name <br/>   that the mouth of the Lord will bestow. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_62_3">  <sup>3</sup>You will be a crown of splendor in the Lord’s hand, <br/>   a royal diadem in the hand of your God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_62_4">  <sup>4</sup>No longer will they call you Deserted, <br/>   or name your land Desolate. <br/>  But you will be called Hephzibah,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means my delight is in her.">⚓</a><br/>   and your land Beulah<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means married.">⚓</a> ; <br/>  for the Lord will take delight in you, <br/>   and your land will be married. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_62_5">  <sup>5</sup>As a young man marries a young woman, <br/>   so will your Builder marry you; <br/>  as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, <br/>   so will your God rejoice over you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_62_6">  <sup>6</sup>I have posted watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; <br/>   they will never be silent day or night. <br/>  You who call on the Lord, <br/>   give yourselves no rest, <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_62_7">  <sup>7</sup>and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem <br/>   and makes her the praise of the earth. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_62_8">  <sup>8</sup>The Lord has sworn by his right hand <br/>   and by his mighty arm: <br/>  “Never again will I give your grain <br/>   as food for your enemies, <br/>  and never again will foreigners drink the new wine <br/>   for which you have toiled; <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_62_9">  <sup>9</sup>but those who harvest it will eat it <br/>   and praise the Lord, <br/>  and those who gather the grapes will drink it <br/>   in the courts of my sanctuary.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_62_10">  <sup>10</sup>Pass through, pass through the gates! <br/>   Prepare the way for the people. <br/>  Build up, build up the highway! <br/>   Remove the stones. <br/>  Raise a banner for the nations. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_62_11">  <sup>11</sup>The Lord has made proclamation <br/>   to the ends of the earth: <br/>  “Say to Daughter Zion, <br/>   ‘See, your Savior comes! <br/>  See, his reward is with him, <br/>   and his recompense accompanies him.’ ” <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_62_12">  <sup>12</sup>They will be called the Holy People, <br/>   the Redeemed of the Lord; <br/>  and you will be called Sought After, <br/>   the City No Longer Deserted. <br/></span>
