<div class="title"><h1>21</h1><h3>A Prophecy Against Babylon </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_21_1"> <sup>1</sup>A prophecy against the Desert by the Sea: <br/>  Like whirlwinds sweeping through the southland, <br/>   an invader comes from the desert, <br/>   from a land of terror. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_21_2">  <sup>2</sup>A dire vision has been shown to me: <br/>   The traitor betrays, the looter takes loot. <br/>  Elam, attack! Media, lay siege! <br/>   I will bring to an end all the groaning she caused. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_21_3">  <sup>3</sup>At this my body is racked with pain, <br/>   pangs seize me, like those of a woman in labor; <br/>  I am staggered by what I hear, <br/>   I am bewildered by what I see. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_21_4">  <sup>4</sup>My heart falters, <br/>   fear makes me tremble; <br/>  the twilight I longed for <br/>   has become a horror to me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_21_5">  <sup>5</sup>They set the tables, <br/>   they spread the rugs, <br/>   they eat, they drink! <br/>  Get up, you officers, <br/>   oil the shields! <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_21_6"> <sup>6</sup>This is what the Lord says to me: <br/>  “Go, post a lookout <br/>   and have him report what he sees. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_21_7">  <sup>7</sup>When he sees chariots <br/>   with teams of horses, <br/>  riders on donkeys <br/>   or riders on camels, <br/>  let him be alert, <br/>   fully alert.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_21_8"> <sup>8</sup>And the lookout<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dead Sea Scrolls and Syriac; Masoretic Text A lion">⚓</a> shouted, <br/>  “Day after day, my lord, I stand on the watchtower; <br/>   every night I stay at my post. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_21_9">  <sup>9</sup>Look, here comes a man in a chariot <br/>   with a team of horses. <br/>  And he gives back the answer: <br/>   ‘Babylon has fallen, has fallen! <br/>  All the images of its gods <br/>   lie shattered on the ground!’ ” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_21_10">  <sup>10</sup>My people who are crushed on the threshing floor, <br/>   I tell you what I have heard <br/>  from the Lord Almighty, <br/>   from the God of Israel. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Prophecy Against Edom </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_21_11"> <sup>11</sup>A prophecy against Dumah<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=", a wordplay on Edom , means silence or stillness.">⚓</a> : <br/>  Someone calls to me from Seir, <br/>   “Watchman, what is left of the night? <br/>   Watchman, what is left of the night?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_21_12">  <sup>12</sup>The watchman replies, <br/>   “Morning is coming, but also the night. <br/>  If you would ask, then ask; <br/>   and come back yet again.” <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Prophecy Against Arabia </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_21_13"> <sup>13</sup>A prophecy against Arabia: <br/>  You caravans of Dedanites, <br/>   who camp in the thickets of Arabia, <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_21_14">   <sup>14</sup>bring water for the thirsty; <br/>  you who live in Tema, <br/>   bring food for the fugitives. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_21_15">  <sup>15</sup>They flee from the sword, <br/>   from the drawn sword, <br/>  from the bent bow <br/>   and from the heat of battle. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_21_16"> <sup>16</sup>This is what the Lord says to me: “Within one year, as a servant bound by contract would count it, all the splendor of Kedar will come to an end. </span>
<span class="verse es_21_17"><sup>17</sup>The survivors of the archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be few.” The Lord, the God of Israel, has spoken. <br/></span>
