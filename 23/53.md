<span class="verse es_53_1">  <sup>1</sup>Who has believed our message <br/>   and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_53_2">  <sup>2</sup>He grew up before him like a tender shoot, <br/>   and like a root out of dry ground. <br/>  He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, <br/>   nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_53_3">  <sup>3</sup>He was despised and rejected by mankind, <br/>   a man of suffering, and familiar with pain. <br/>  Like one from whom people hide their faces <br/>   he was despised, and we held him in low esteem. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_53_4">  <sup>4</sup>Surely he took up our pain <br/>   and bore our suffering, <br/>  yet we considered him punished by God, <br/>   stricken by him, and afflicted. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_53_5">  <sup>5</sup>But he was pierced for our transgressions, <br/>   he was crushed for our iniquities; <br/>  the punishment that brought us peace was on him, <br/>   and by his wounds we are healed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_53_6">  <sup>6</sup>We all, like sheep, have gone astray, <br/>   each of us has turned to our own way; <br/>  and the Lord has laid on him <br/>   the iniquity of us all. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_53_7">  <sup>7</sup>He was oppressed and afflicted, <br/>   yet he did not open his mouth; <br/>  he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, <br/>   and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, <br/>   so he did not open his mouth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_53_8">  <sup>8</sup>By oppression<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or From arrest">⚓</a> and judgment he was taken away. <br/>   Yet who of his generation protested? <br/>  For he was cut off from the land of the living; <br/>   for the transgression of my people he was punished.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or generation considered / that he was cut off from the land of the living, / that he was punished for the transgression of my people?">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_53_9">  <sup>9</sup>He was assigned a grave with the wicked, <br/>   and with the rich in his death, <br/>  though he had done no violence, <br/>   nor was any deceit in his mouth. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_53_10">  <sup>10</sup>Yet it was the Lord’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer, <br/>   and though the Lord makes<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew though you make">⚓</a> his life an offering for sin, <br/>  he will see his offspring and prolong his days, <br/>   and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_53_11">  <sup>11</sup>After he has suffered, <br/>   he will see the light of life<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dead Sea Scrolls (see also Septuagint); Masoretic Text does not have the light of life.">⚓</a> and be satisfied<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or (with Masoretic Text) 11He will see the fruit of his suffering / and will be satisfied">⚓</a> ; <br/>  by his knowledge<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or by knowledge of him">⚓</a> my righteous servant will justify many, <br/>   and he will bear their iniquities. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_53_12">  <sup>12</sup>Therefore I will give him a portion among the great,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or many">⚓</a><br/>   and he will divide the spoils with the strong,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or numerous">⚓</a><br/>  because he poured out his life unto death, <br/>   and was numbered with the transgressors. <br/>  For he bore the sin of many, <br/>   and made intercession for the transgressors. <br/></span>
