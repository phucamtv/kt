<div class="title"><h1>34</h1><h3>Judgment Against the Nations </h3></div>
<span class="verse es_34_1">  <sup>1</sup>Come near, you nations, and listen; <br/>   pay attention, you peoples! <br/>  Let the earth hear, and all that is in it, <br/>   the world, and all that comes out of it! <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_34_2">  <sup>2</sup>The Lord is angry with all nations; <br/>   his wrath is on all their armies. <br/>  He will totally destroy<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew term refers to the irrevocable giving over of things or persons to the Lord, often by totally destroying them; also in verse 5.">⚓</a> them, <br/>   he will give them over to slaughter. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_34_3">  <sup>3</sup>Their slain will be thrown out, <br/>   their dead bodies will stink; <br/>   the mountains will be soaked with their blood. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_34_4">  <sup>4</sup>All the stars in the sky will be dissolved <br/>   and the heavens rolled up like a scroll; <br/>  all the starry host will fall <br/>   like withered leaves from the vine, <br/>   like shriveled figs from the fig tree. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_34_5">  <sup>5</sup>My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; <br/>   see, it descends in judgment on Edom, <br/>   the people I have totally destroyed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_34_6">  <sup>6</sup>The sword of the Lord is bathed in blood, <br/>   it is covered with fat— <br/>  the blood of lambs and goats, <br/>   fat from the kidneys of rams. <br/>  For the Lord has a sacrifice in Bozrah <br/>   and a great slaughter in the land of Edom. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_34_7">  <sup>7</sup>And the wild oxen will fall with them, <br/>   the bull calves and the great bulls. <br/>  Their land will be drenched with blood, <br/>   and the dust will be soaked with fat. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse es_34_8">  <sup>8</sup>For the Lord has a day of vengeance, <br/>   a year of retribution, to uphold Zion’s cause. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_34_9">  <sup>9</sup>Edom’s streams will be turned into pitch, <br/>   her dust into burning sulfur; <br/>   her land will become blazing pitch! <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_34_10">  <sup>10</sup>It will not be quenched night or day; <br/>   its smoke will rise forever. <br/>  From generation to generation it will lie desolate; <br/>   no one will ever pass through it again. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_34_11">  <sup>11</sup>The desert owl<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The precise identification of these birds is uncertain.">⚓</a> and screech owl<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The precise identification of these birds is uncertain.">⚓</a> will possess it; <br/>   the great owl<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The precise identification of these birds is uncertain.">⚓</a> and the raven will nest there. <br/>  God will stretch out over Edom <br/>   the measuring line of chaos <br/>   and the plumb line of desolation. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_34_12">  <sup>12</sup>Her nobles will have nothing there to be called a kingdom, <br/>   all her princes will vanish away. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_34_13">  <sup>13</sup>Thorns will overrun her citadels, <br/>   nettles and brambles her strongholds. <br/>  She will become a haunt for jackals, <br/>   a home for owls. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_34_14">  <sup>14</sup>Desert creatures will meet with hyenas, <br/>   and wild goats will bleat to each other; <br/>  there the night creatures will also lie down <br/>   and find for themselves places of rest. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_34_15">  <sup>15</sup>The owl will nest there and lay eggs, <br/>   she will hatch them, and care for her young <br/>   under the shadow of her wings; <br/>  there also the falcons will gather, <br/>   each with its mate. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_34_16"> <sup>16</sup>Look in the scroll of the Lord and read: <br/>  None of these will be missing, <br/>   not one will lack her mate. <br/>  For it is his mouth that has given the order, <br/>   and his Spirit will gather them together. <br/></span>
<span class="verse es_34_17">  <sup>17</sup>He allots their portions; <br/>   his hand distributes them by measure. <br/>  They will possess it forever <br/>   and dwell there from generation to generation. <br/></span>
