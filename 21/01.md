<div class="title"><h1>1</h1><h3>Everything Is Meaningless </h3></div>
<span class="verse tr_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>The words of the Teacher,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or the leader of the assembly ; also in verses 2 and 12">⚓</a> son of David, king in Jerusalem: <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_1_2">  <sup>2</sup>“Meaningless! Meaningless!” <br/>   says the Teacher. <br/>  “Utterly meaningless! <br/>   Everything is meaningless.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_1_3">  <sup>3</sup>What do people gain from all their labors <br/>   at which they toil under the sun? <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_1_4">  <sup>4</sup>Generations come and generations go, <br/>   but the earth remains forever. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_1_5">  <sup>5</sup>The sun rises and the sun sets, <br/>   and hurries back to where it rises. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_1_6">  <sup>6</sup>The wind blows to the south <br/>   and turns to the north; <br/>  round and round it goes, <br/>   ever returning on its course. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_1_7">  <sup>7</sup>All streams flow into the sea, <br/>   yet the sea is never full. <br/>  To the place the streams come from, <br/>   there they return again. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_1_8">  <sup>8</sup>All things are wearisome, <br/>   more than one can say. <br/>  The eye never has enough of seeing, <br/>   nor the ear its fill of hearing. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_1_9">  <sup>9</sup>What has been will be again, <br/>   what has been done will be done again; <br/>   there is nothing new under the sun. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_1_10">  <sup>10</sup>Is there anything of which one can say, <br/>   “Look! This is something new”? <br/>  It was here already, long ago; <br/>   it was here before our time. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_1_11">  <sup>11</sup>No one remembers the former generations, <br/>   and even those yet to come <br/>  will not be remembered <br/>   by those who follow them. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Wisdom Is Meaningless </h3></div>
<span class="verse tr_1_12"> <sup>12</sup>I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse tr_1_13"><sup>13</sup>I applied my mind to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. What a heavy burden God has laid on mankind! </span>
<span class="verse tr_1_14"><sup>14</sup>I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_1_15">  <sup>15</sup>What is crooked cannot be straightened; <br/>   what is lacking cannot be counted. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_1_16"> <sup>16</sup>I said to myself, “Look, I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge.” </span>
<span class="verse tr_1_17"><sup>17</sup>Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_1_18">  <sup>18</sup>For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; <br/>   the more knowledge, the more grief. <br/></span>
