<div class="title"><h1>7</h1><h3>Wisdom </h3></div>
<span class="verse tr_7_1">  <sup>1</sup>A good name is better than fine perfume, <br/>   and the day of death better than the day of birth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_2">  <sup>2</sup>It is better to go to a house of mourning <br/>   than to go to a house of feasting, <br/>  for death is the destiny of everyone; <br/>   the living should take this to heart. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_3">  <sup>3</sup>Frustration is better than laughter, <br/>   because a sad face is good for the heart. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_4">  <sup>4</sup>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, <br/>   but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_5">  <sup>5</sup>It is better to heed the rebuke of a wise person <br/>   than to listen to the song of fools. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_6">  <sup>6</sup>Like the crackling of thorns under the pot, <br/>   so is the laughter of fools. <br/>   This too is meaningless. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_7">  <sup>7</sup>Extortion turns a wise person into a fool, <br/>   and a bribe corrupts the heart. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_8">  <sup>8</sup>The end of a matter is better than its beginning, <br/>   and patience is better than pride. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_9">  <sup>9</sup>Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, <br/>   for anger resides in the lap of fools. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_10">  <sup>10</sup>Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these?” <br/>   For it is not wise to ask such questions. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_11">  <sup>11</sup>Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing <br/>   and benefits those who see the sun. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_12">  <sup>12</sup>Wisdom is a shelter <br/>   as money is a shelter, <br/>  but the advantage of knowledge is this: <br/>   Wisdom preserves those who have it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_13"> <sup>13</sup>Consider what God has done: <br/>  Who can straighten <br/>   what he has made crooked? <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_14">  <sup>14</sup>When times are good, be happy; <br/>   but when times are bad, consider this: <br/>  God has made the one <br/>   as well as the other. <br/>  Therefore, no one can discover <br/>   anything about their future. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_15"> <sup>15</sup>In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these: <br/>  the righteous perishing in their righteousness, <br/>   and the wicked living long in their wickedness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_16">  <sup>16</sup>Do not be overrighteous, <br/>   neither be overwise— <br/>   why destroy yourself? <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_17">  <sup>17</sup>Do not be overwicked, <br/>   and do not be a fool— <br/>   why die before your time? <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_18">  <sup>18</sup>It is good to grasp the one <br/>   and not let go of the other. <br/>   Whoever fears God will avoid all extremes.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or will follow them both">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_19">  <sup>19</sup>Wisdom makes one wise person more powerful <br/>   than ten rulers in a city. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_20">  <sup>20</sup>Indeed, there is no one on earth who is righteous, <br/>   no one who does what is right and never sins. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_21">  <sup>21</sup>Do not pay attention to every word people say, <br/>   or you may hear your servant cursing you— <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_22">  <sup>22</sup>for you know in your heart <br/>   that many times you yourself have cursed others. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_23"> <sup>23</sup>All this I tested by wisdom and I said, <br/>  “I am determined to be wise”— <br/>   but this was beyond me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_24">  <sup>24</sup>Whatever exists is far off and most profound— <br/>   who can discover it? <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_25">  <sup>25</sup>So I turned my mind to understand, <br/>   to investigate and to search out wisdom and the scheme of things <br/>  and to understand the stupidity of wickedness <br/>   and the madness of folly. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_26">  <sup>26</sup>I find more bitter than death <br/>   the woman who is a snare, <br/>  whose heart is a trap <br/>   and whose hands are chains. <br/>  The man who pleases God will escape her, <br/>   but the sinner she will ensnare. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_27"> <sup>27</sup>“Look,” says the Teacher,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or the leader of the assembly">⚓</a> “this is what I have discovered: <br/>  “Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things— <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_28">   <sup>28</sup>while I was still searching <br/>   but not finding— <br/>  I found one upright man among a thousand, <br/>   but not one upright woman among them all. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_7_29">  <sup>29</sup>This only have I found: <br/>   God created mankind upright, <br/>   but they have gone in search of many schemes.” <br/><br/></span>
