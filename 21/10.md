<div class="title"><h1>10</h1></div>
<span class="verse tr_10_1">  <sup>1</sup>As dead flies give perfume a bad smell, <br/>   so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_10_2">  <sup>2</sup>The heart of the wise inclines to the right, <br/>   but the heart of the fool to the left. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_10_3">  <sup>3</sup>Even as fools walk along the road, <br/>   they lack sense <br/>   and show everyone how stupid they are. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_10_4">  <sup>4</sup>If a ruler’s anger rises against you, <br/>   do not leave your post; <br/>   calmness can lay great offenses to rest. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_10_5">  <sup>5</sup>There is an evil I have seen under the sun, <br/>   the sort of error that arises from a ruler: <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_10_6">  <sup>6</sup>Fools are put in many high positions, <br/>   while the rich occupy the low ones. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_10_7">  <sup>7</sup>I have seen slaves on horseback, <br/>   while princes go on foot like slaves. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_10_8">  <sup>8</sup>Whoever digs a pit may fall into it; <br/>   whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_10_9">  <sup>9</sup>Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them; <br/>   whoever splits logs may be endangered by them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_10_10">  <sup>10</sup>If the ax is dull <br/>   and its edge unsharpened, <br/>  more strength is needed, <br/>   but skill will bring success. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_10_11">  <sup>11</sup>If a snake bites before it is charmed, <br/>   the charmer receives no fee. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_10_12">  <sup>12</sup>Words from the mouth of the wise are gracious, <br/>   but fools are consumed by their own lips. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_10_13">  <sup>13</sup>At the beginning their words are folly; <br/>   at the end they are wicked madness— <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_10_14">   <sup>14</sup>and fools multiply words. <br/><br/>  No one knows what is coming— <br/>   who can tell someone else what will happen after them? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_10_15">  <sup>15</sup>The toil of fools wearies them; <br/>   they do not know the way to town. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_10_16">  <sup>16</sup>Woe to the land whose king was a servant<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or king is a child">⚓</a><br/>   and whose princes feast in the morning. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_10_17">  <sup>17</sup>Blessed is the land whose king is of noble birth <br/>   and whose princes eat at a proper time— <br/>   for strength and not for drunkenness. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_10_18">  <sup>18</sup>Through laziness, the rafters sag; <br/>   because of idle hands, the house leaks. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_10_19">  <sup>19</sup>A feast is made for laughter, <br/>   wine makes life merry, <br/>   and money is the answer for everything. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_10_20">  <sup>20</sup>Do not revile the king even in your thoughts, <br/>   or curse the rich in your bedroom, <br/>  because a bird in the sky may carry your words, <br/>   and a bird on the wing may report what you say. <br/></span>
