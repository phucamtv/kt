<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>Invest in Many Ventures </h3></div>
<span class="verse tr_11_1">  <sup>1</sup>Ship your grain across the sea; <br/>   after many days you may receive a return. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_11_2">  <sup>2</sup>Invest in seven ventures, yes, in eight; <br/>   you do not know what disaster may come upon the land. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_11_3">  <sup>3</sup>If clouds are full of water, <br/>   they pour rain on the earth. <br/>  Whether a tree falls to the south or to the north, <br/>   in the place where it falls, there it will lie. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_11_4">  <sup>4</sup>Whoever watches the wind will not plant; <br/>   whoever looks at the clouds will not reap. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_11_5">  <sup>5</sup>As you do not know the path of the wind, <br/>   or how the body is formed<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or know how life (or the spirit ) / enters the body being formed">⚓</a> in a mother’s womb, <br/>  so you cannot understand the work of God, <br/>   the Maker of all things. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_11_6">  <sup>6</sup>Sow your seed in the morning, <br/>   and at evening let your hands not be idle, <br/>  for you do not know which will succeed, <br/>   whether this or that, <br/>   or whether both will do equally well. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Remember Your Creator While Young </h3></div>
<span class="verse tr_11_7">  <sup>7</sup>Light is sweet, <br/>   and it pleases the eyes to see the sun. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_11_8">  <sup>8</sup>However many years anyone may live, <br/>   let them enjoy them all. <br/>  But let them remember the days of darkness, <br/>   for there will be many. <br/>   Everything to come is meaningless. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_11_9">  <sup>9</sup>You who are young, be happy while you are young, <br/>   and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth. <br/>  Follow the ways of your heart <br/>   and whatever your eyes see, <br/>  but know that for all these things <br/>   God will bring you into judgment. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_11_10">  <sup>10</sup>So then, banish anxiety from your heart <br/>   and cast off the troubles of your body, <br/>   for youth and vigor are meaningless. <br/><br/></span>
