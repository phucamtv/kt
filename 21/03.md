<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>A Time for Everything </h3></div>
<span class="verse tr_3_1">  <sup>1</sup>There is a time for everything, <br/>   and a season for every activity under the heavens: <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_3_2">   <sup>2</sup>a time to be born and a time to die, <br/>   a time to plant and a time to uproot, <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_3_3">   <sup>3</sup>a time to kill and a time to heal, <br/>   a time to tear down and a time to build, <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_3_4">   <sup>4</sup>a time to weep and a time to laugh, <br/>   a time to mourn and a time to dance, <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_3_5">   <sup>5</sup>a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, <br/>   a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing, <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_3_6">   <sup>6</sup>a time to search and a time to give up, <br/>   a time to keep and a time to throw away, <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_3_7">   <sup>7</sup>a time to tear and a time to mend, <br/>   a time to be silent and a time to speak, <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_3_8">   <sup>8</sup>a time to love and a time to hate, <br/>   a time for war and a time for peace. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_3_9"> <sup>9</sup>What do workers gain from their toil? </span>
<span class="verse tr_3_10"><sup>10</sup>I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race. </span>
<span class="verse tr_3_11"><sup>11</sup>He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or also placed ignorance in the human heart, so that">⚓</a> no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end. </span>
<span class="verse tr_3_12"><sup>12</sup>I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live. </span>
<span class="verse tr_3_13"><sup>13</sup>That each of them may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all their toil—this is the gift of God. </span>
<span class="verse tr_3_14"><sup>14</sup>I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that people will fear him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_3_15">  <sup>15</sup>Whatever is has already been, <br/>   and what will be has been before; <br/>   and God will call the past to account.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or God calls back the past">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_3_16"> <sup>16</sup>And I saw something else under the sun: <br/>  In the place of judgment—wickedness was there, <br/>   in the place of justice—wickedness was there. <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_3_17"> <sup>17</sup>I said to myself, <br/>  “God will bring into judgment <br/>   both the righteous and the wicked, <br/>  for there will be a time for every activity, <br/>   a time to judge every deed.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_3_18"> <sup>18</sup>I also said to myself, “As for humans, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals. </span>
<span class="verse tr_3_19"><sup>19</sup>Surely the fate of human beings is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or spirit">⚓</a> ; humans have no advantage over animals. Everything is meaningless. </span>
<span class="verse tr_3_20"><sup>20</sup>All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return. </span>
<span class="verse tr_3_21"><sup>21</sup>Who knows if the human spirit rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_3_22"> <sup>22</sup>So I saw that there is nothing better for a person than to enjoy their work, because that is their lot. For who can bring them to see what will happen after them? <br/></span>
