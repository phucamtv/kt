<span class="verse ro_10_1"> <sup>1</sup>Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved. </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_2"><sup>2</sup>For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge. </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_3"><sup>3</sup>Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness. </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_4"><sup>4</sup>Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_10_5"> <sup>5</sup>Moses writes this about the righteousness that is by the law: “The person who does these things will live by them.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 18:5">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse ro_10_6"><sup>6</sup>But the righteousness that is by faith says: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ ”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 30:12">⚓</a> (that is, to bring Christ down) </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_7"><sup>7</sup>“or ‘Who will descend into the deep?’ ”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 30:13">⚓</a> (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_8"><sup>8</sup>But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 30:14">⚓</a> that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim: </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_9"><sup>9</sup>If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_10"><sup>10</sup>For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_11"><sup>11</sup>As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 28:16 (see Septuagint)">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse ro_10_12"><sup>12</sup>For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_13"><sup>13</sup>for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Joel 2:32">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_10_14"> <sup>14</sup>How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_15"><sup>15</sup>And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 52:7">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_10_16"> <sup>16</sup>But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 53:1">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse ro_10_17"><sup>17</sup>Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ. </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_18"><sup>18</sup>But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did: <br/>  “Their voice has gone out into all the earth, <br/>   their words to the ends of the world.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 19:4">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_10_19"><sup>19</sup>Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, <br/>  “I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; <br/>   I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:21">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_10_20"><sup>20</sup>And Isaiah boldly says, <br/>  “I was found by those who did not seek me; <br/>   I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 65:1">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_10_21"><sup>21</sup>But concerning Israel he says, <br/>  “All day long I have held out my hands <br/>   to a disobedient and obstinate people.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 65:2">⚓</a><br/></span>
