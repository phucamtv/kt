<div class="title"><h1>12</h1><h3>A Living Sacrifice </h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_12_1"> <sup>1</sup>Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship. </span>
<span class="verse ro_12_2"><sup>2</sup>Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Humble Service in the Body of Christ </h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_12_3"> <sup>3</sup>For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you. </span>
<span class="verse ro_12_4"><sup>4</sup>For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, </span>
<span class="verse ro_12_5"><sup>5</sup>so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. </span>
<span class="verse ro_12_6"><sup>6</sup>We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or the">⚓</a> faith; </span>
<span class="verse ro_12_7"><sup>7</sup>if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach; </span>
<span class="verse ro_12_8"><sup>8</sup>if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or to provide for others">⚓</a> do it diligently; if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Love in Action </h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_12_9"> <sup>9</sup>Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. </span>
<span class="verse ro_12_10"><sup>10</sup>Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves. </span>
<span class="verse ro_12_11"><sup>11</sup>Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse ro_12_12"><sup>12</sup>Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. </span>
<span class="verse ro_12_13"><sup>13</sup>Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_12_14"> <sup>14</sup>Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. </span>
<span class="verse ro_12_15"><sup>15</sup>Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn. </span>
<span class="verse ro_12_16"><sup>16</sup>Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or willing to do menial work">⚓</a> Do not be conceited. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_12_17"> <sup>17</sup>Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. </span>
<span class="verse ro_12_18"><sup>18</sup>If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. </span>
<span class="verse ro_12_19"><sup>19</sup>Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:35">⚓</a> says the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse ro_12_20"><sup>20</sup>On the contrary: <br/>  “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; <br/>   if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. <br/>  In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 25:21,22">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_12_21"><sup>21</sup>Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. <br/></span>
