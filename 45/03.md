<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>God’s Faithfulness </h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew, or what value is there in circumcision? </span>
<span class="verse ro_3_2"><sup>2</sup>Much in every way! First of all, the Jews have been entrusted with the very words of God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_3_3"> <sup>3</sup>What if some were unfaithful? Will their unfaithfulness nullify God’s faithfulness? </span>
<span class="verse ro_3_4"><sup>4</sup>Not at all! Let God be true, and every human being a liar. As it is written: <br/>  “So that you may be proved right when you speak <br/>   and prevail when you judge.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 51:4">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_3_5"> <sup>5</sup>But if our unrighteousness brings out God’s righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.) </span>
<span class="verse ro_3_6"><sup>6</sup>Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world? </span>
<span class="verse ro_3_7"><sup>7</sup>Someone might argue, “If my falsehood enhances God’s truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?” </span>
<span class="verse ro_3_8"><sup>8</sup>Why not say—as some slanderously claim that we say—“Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is just! <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>No One Is Righteous </h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_3_9"> <sup>9</sup>What shall we conclude then? Do we have any advantage? Not at all! For we have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin. </span>
<span class="verse ro_3_10"><sup>10</sup>As it is written: <br/>  “There is no one righteous, not even one; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_3_11">   <sup>11</sup>there is no one who understands; <br/>   there is no one who seeks God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_3_12">  <sup>12</sup>All have turned away, <br/>   they have together become worthless; <br/>  there is no one who does good, <br/>   not even one.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalms 14:1-3; 53:1-3; Eccles. 7:20">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_3_13">  <sup>13</sup>“Their throats are open graves; <br/>   their tongues practice deceit.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 5:9">⚓</a><br/>  “The poison of vipers is on their lips.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 140:3">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_3_14">   <sup>14</sup>“Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 10:7 (see Septuagint)">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_3_15">  <sup>15</sup>“Their feet are swift to shed blood; <br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_3_16">   <sup>16</sup>ruin and misery mark their ways, <br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_3_17">  <sup>17</sup>and the way of peace they do not know.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 59:7,8">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_3_18">   <sup>18</sup>“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 36:1">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_3_19"> <sup>19</sup>Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. </span>
<span class="verse ro_3_20"><sup>20</sup>Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Righteousness Through Faith </h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_3_21"> <sup>21</sup>But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. </span>
<span class="verse ro_3_22"><sup>22</sup>This righteousness is given through faith in<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or through the faithfulness of">⚓</a> Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, </span>
<span class="verse ro_3_23"><sup>23</sup>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, </span>
<span class="verse ro_3_24"><sup>24</sup>and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse ro_3_25"><sup>25</sup>God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek for sacrifice of atonement refers to the atonement cover on the ark of the covenant (see Lev. 16:15,16).">⚓</a> through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished— </span>
<span class="verse ro_3_26"><sup>26</sup>he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_3_27"> <sup>27</sup>Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith. </span>
<span class="verse ro_3_28"><sup>28</sup>For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. </span>
<span class="verse ro_3_29"><sup>29</sup>Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, </span>
<span class="verse ro_3_30"><sup>30</sup>since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith. </span>
<span class="verse ro_3_31"><sup>31</sup>Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law. <br/></span>
