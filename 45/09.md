<div class="title"><h1>9</h1><h3>Paul’s Anguish Over Israel </h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>I speak the truth in Christ—I am not lying, my conscience confirms it through the Holy Spirit— </span>
<span class="verse ro_9_2"><sup>2</sup>I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. </span>
<span class="verse ro_9_3"><sup>3</sup>For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my people, those of my own race, </span>
<span class="verse ro_9_4"><sup>4</sup>the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption to sonship; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises. </span>
<span class="verse ro_9_5"><sup>5</sup>Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of the Messiah, who is God over all, forever praised!<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Messiah, who is over all. God be forever praised! Or Messiah. God who is over all be forever praised!">⚓</a> Amen. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>God’s Sovereign Choice </h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_9_6"> <sup>6</sup>It is not as though God’s word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. </span>
<span class="verse ro_9_7"><sup>7</sup>Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham’s children. On the contrary, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:12">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse ro_9_8"><sup>8</sup>In other words, it is not the children by physical descent who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham’s offspring. </span>
<span class="verse ro_9_9"><sup>9</sup>For this was how the promise was stated: “At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:10,14">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_9_10"> <sup>10</sup>Not only that, but Rebekah’s children were conceived at the same time by our father Isaac. </span>
<span class="verse ro_9_11"><sup>11</sup>Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad—in order that God’s purpose in election might stand: </span>
<span class="verse ro_9_12"><sup>12</sup>not by works but by him who calls—she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:23">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse ro_9_13"><sup>13</sup>Just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 1:2,3">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_9_14"> <sup>14</sup>What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all! </span>
<span class="verse ro_9_15"><sup>15</sup>For he says to Moses, <br/>  “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, <br/>   and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Exodus 33:19">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_9_16"><sup>16</sup>It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy. </span>
<span class="verse ro_9_17"><sup>17</sup>For Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Exodus 9:16">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse ro_9_18"><sup>18</sup>Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_9_19"> <sup>19</sup>One of you will say to me: “Then why does God still blame us? For who is able to resist his will?” </span>
<span class="verse ro_9_20"><sup>20</sup>But who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? “Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’ ”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 29:16; 45:9">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse ro_9_21"><sup>21</sup>Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use? <br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_9_22"> <sup>22</sup>What if God, although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath—prepared for destruction? </span>
<span class="verse ro_9_23"><sup>23</sup>What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory— </span>
<span class="verse ro_9_24"><sup>24</sup>even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? </span>
<span class="verse ro_9_25"><sup>25</sup>As he says in Hosea: <br/>  “I will call them ‘my people’ who are not my people; <br/>   and I will call her ‘my loved one’ who is not my loved one,”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hosea 2:23">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_9_26"><sup>26</sup>and, <br/>  “In the very place where it was said to them, <br/>   ‘You are not my people,’ <br/>   there they will be called ‘children of the living God.’ ”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hosea 1:10">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_9_27"><sup>27</sup>Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: <br/>  “Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, <br/>   only the remnant will be saved. <br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_9_28">  <sup>28</sup>For the Lord will carry out <br/>   his sentence on earth with speed and finality.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 10:22,23 (see Septuagint)">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_9_29"><sup>29</sup>It is just as Isaiah said previously: <br/>  “Unless the Lord Almighty <br/>   had left us descendants, <br/>  we would have become like Sodom, <br/>   we would have been like Gomorrah.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 1:9">⚓</a><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Israel’s Unbelief </h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_9_30"> <sup>30</sup>What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith; </span>
<span class="verse ro_9_31"><sup>31</sup>but the people of Israel, who pursued the law as the way of righteousness, have not attained their goal. </span>
<span class="verse ro_9_32"><sup>32</sup>Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone. </span>
<span class="verse ro_9_33"><sup>33</sup>As it is written: <br/>  “See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes people to stumble <br/>   and a rock that makes them fall, <br/>   and the one who believes in him will never be put to shame.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 8:14; 28:16">⚓</a><br/></span>
