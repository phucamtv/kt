<span class="verse thi_109_1">  <sup>1</sup>My God, whom I praise, <br/>   do not remain silent, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_2">  <sup>2</sup>for people who are wicked and deceitful <br/>   have opened their mouths against me; <br/>   they have spoken against me with lying tongues. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_3">  <sup>3</sup>With words of hatred they surround me; <br/>   they attack me without cause. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_4">  <sup>4</sup>In return for my friendship they accuse me, <br/>   but I am a man of prayer. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_5">  <sup>5</sup>They repay me evil for good, <br/>   and hatred for my friendship. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_6">  <sup>6</sup>Appoint someone evil to oppose my enemy; <br/>   let an accuser stand at his right hand. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_7">  <sup>7</sup>When he is tried, let him be found guilty, <br/>   and may his prayers condemn him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_8">  <sup>8</sup>May his days be few; <br/>   may another take his place of leadership. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_9">  <sup>9</sup>May his children be fatherless <br/>   and his wife a widow. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_10">  <sup>10</sup>May his children be wandering beggars; <br/>   may they be driven<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint; Hebrew sought">⚓</a> from their ruined homes. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_11">  <sup>11</sup>May a creditor seize all he has; <br/>   may strangers plunder the fruits of his labor. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_12">  <sup>12</sup>May no one extend kindness to him <br/>   or take pity on his fatherless children. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_13">  <sup>13</sup>May his descendants be cut off, <br/>   their names blotted out from the next generation. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_14">  <sup>14</sup>May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord; <br/>   may the sin of his mother never be blotted out. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_15">  <sup>15</sup>May their sins always remain before the Lord, <br/>   that he may blot out their name from the earth. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_16">  <sup>16</sup>For he never thought of doing a kindness, <br/>   but hounded to death the poor <br/>   and the needy and the brokenhearted. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_17">  <sup>17</sup>He loved to pronounce a curse— <br/>   may it come back on him. <br/>  He found no pleasure in blessing— <br/>   may it be far from him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_18">  <sup>18</sup>He wore cursing as his garment; <br/>   it entered into his body like water, <br/>   into his bones like oil. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_19">  <sup>19</sup>May it be like a cloak wrapped about him, <br/>   like a belt tied forever around him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_20">  <sup>20</sup>May this be the Lord’s payment to my accusers, <br/>   to those who speak evil of me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_21">  <sup>21</sup>But you, Sovereign Lord, <br/>   help me for your name’s sake; <br/>   out of the goodness of your love, deliver me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_22">  <sup>22</sup>For I am poor and needy, <br/>   and my heart is wounded within me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_23">  <sup>23</sup>I fade away like an evening shadow; <br/>   I am shaken off like a locust. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_24">  <sup>24</sup>My knees give way from fasting; <br/>   my body is thin and gaunt. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_25">  <sup>25</sup>I am an object of scorn to my accusers; <br/>   when they see me, they shake their heads. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_26">  <sup>26</sup>Help me, Lord my God; <br/>   save me according to your unfailing love. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_27">  <sup>27</sup>Let them know that it is your hand, <br/>   that you, Lord, have done it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_28">  <sup>28</sup>While they curse, may you bless; <br/>   may those who attack me be put to shame, <br/>   but may your servant rejoice. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_29">  <sup>29</sup>May my accusers be clothed with disgrace <br/>   and wrapped in shame as in a cloak. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_30">  <sup>30</sup>With my mouth I will greatly extol the Lord; <br/>   in the great throng of worshipers I will praise him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_109_31">  <sup>31</sup>For he stands at the right hand of the needy, <br/>   to save their lives from those who would condemn them. <br/></span>
