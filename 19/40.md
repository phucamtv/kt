<span class="verse thi_40_1">  <sup>1</sup>I waited patiently for the Lord; <br/>   he turned to me and heard my cry. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_40_2">  <sup>2</sup>He lifted me out of the slimy pit, <br/>   out of the mud and mire; <br/>  he set my feet on a rock <br/>   and gave me a firm place to stand. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_40_3">  <sup>3</sup>He put a new song in my mouth, <br/>   a hymn of praise to our God. <br/>  Many will see and fear the Lord<br/>   and put their trust in him. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_40_4">  <sup>4</sup>Blessed is the one <br/>   who trusts in the Lord, <br/>  who does not look to the proud, <br/>   to those who turn aside to false gods.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or to lies">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_40_5">  <sup>5</sup>Many, Lord my God, <br/>   are the wonders you have done, <br/>   the things you planned for us. <br/>  None can compare with you; <br/>   were I to speak and tell of your deeds, <br/>   they would be too many to declare. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_40_6">  <sup>6</sup>Sacrifice and offering you did not desire— <br/>   but my ears you have opened<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew; some Septuagint manuscripts but a body you have prepared for me">⚓</a> — <br/>   burnt offerings and sin offerings<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or purification offerings">⚓</a> you did not require. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_40_7">  <sup>7</sup>Then I said, “Here I am, I have come— <br/>   it is written about me in the scroll.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or come / with the scroll written for me">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_40_8">  <sup>8</sup>I desire to do your will, my God; <br/>   your law is within my heart.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_40_9">  <sup>9</sup>I proclaim your saving acts in the great assembly; <br/>   I do not seal my lips, Lord, <br/>   as you know. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_40_10">  <sup>10</sup>I do not hide your righteousness in my heart; <br/>   I speak of your faithfulness and your saving help. <br/>  I do not conceal your love and your faithfulness <br/>   from the great assembly. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_40_11">  <sup>11</sup>Do not withhold your mercy from me, Lord; <br/>   may your love and faithfulness always protect me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_40_12">  <sup>12</sup>For troubles without number surround me; <br/>   my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see. <br/>  They are more than the hairs of my head, <br/>   and my heart fails within me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_40_13">  <sup>13</sup>Be pleased to save me, Lord; <br/>   come quickly, Lord, to help me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_40_14">  <sup>14</sup>May all who want to take my life <br/>   be put to shame and confusion; <br/>  may all who desire my ruin <br/>   be turned back in disgrace. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_40_15">  <sup>15</sup>May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” <br/>   be appalled at their own shame. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_40_16">  <sup>16</sup>But may all who seek you <br/>   rejoice and be glad in you; <br/>  may those who long for your saving help always say, <br/>   “The Lord is great!” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_40_17">  <sup>17</sup>But as for me, I am poor and needy; <br/>   may the Lord think of me. <br/>  You are my help and my deliverer; <br/>   you are my God, do not delay. <br/></span>
