<span class="verse thi_59_11">  <sup>11</sup>But do not kill them, Lord our shield,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or sovereign">⚓</a><br/>   or my people will forget. <br/>  In your might uproot them <br/>   and bring them down. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_59_12">  <sup>12</sup>For the sins of their mouths, <br/>   for the words of their lips, <br/>   let them be caught in their pride. <br/>  For the curses and lies they utter, <br/></span>
