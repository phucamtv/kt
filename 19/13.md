<span class="verse thi_13_1">  <sup>1</sup>How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever? <br/>   How long will you hide your face from me? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_13_2">  <sup>2</sup>How long must I wrestle with my thoughts <br/>   and day after day have sorrow in my heart? <br/>   How long will my enemy triumph over me? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_13_3">  <sup>3</sup>Look on me and answer, Lord my God. <br/>   Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep in death, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_13_4">  <sup>4</sup>and my enemy will say, “I have overcome him,” <br/>   and my foes will rejoice when I fall. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_13_5">  <sup>5</sup>But I trust in your unfailing love; <br/>   my heart rejoices in your salvation. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_13_6">  <sup>6</sup>I will sing the Lord’s praise, <br/>   for he has been good to me. <br/></span>
