<span class="verse thi_48_1">  <sup>1</sup>Great is the Lord, and most worthy of praise, <br/>   in the city of our God, his holy mountain. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_48_2">  <sup>2</sup>Beautiful in its loftiness, <br/>   the joy of the whole earth, <br/>  like the heights of Zaphon<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="was the most sacred mountain of the Canaanites.">⚓</a> is Mount Zion, <br/>   the city of the Great King. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_48_3">  <sup>3</sup>God is in her citadels; <br/>   he has shown himself to be her fortress. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_48_4">  <sup>4</sup>When the kings joined forces, <br/>   when they advanced together, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_48_5">  <sup>5</sup>they saw her and were astounded; <br/>   they fled in terror. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_48_6">  <sup>6</sup>Trembling seized them there, <br/>   pain like that of a woman in labor. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_48_7">  <sup>7</sup>You destroyed them like ships of Tarshish <br/>   shattered by an east wind. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_48_8">  <sup>8</sup>As we have heard, <br/>   so we have seen <br/>  in the city of the Lord Almighty, <br/>   in the city of our God: <br/>  God makes her secure <br/>   forever.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here.">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_48_9">  <sup>9</sup>Within your temple, O God, <br/>   we meditate on your unfailing love. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_48_10">  <sup>10</sup>Like your name, O God, <br/>   your praise reaches to the ends of the earth; <br/>   your right hand is filled with righteousness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_48_11">  <sup>11</sup>Mount Zion rejoices, <br/>   the villages of Judah are glad <br/>   because of your judgments. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_48_12">  <sup>12</sup>Walk about Zion, go around her, <br/>   count her towers, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_48_13">  <sup>13</sup>consider well her ramparts, <br/>   view her citadels, <br/>  that you may tell of them <br/>   to the next generation. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_48_14">  <sup>14</sup>For this God is our God for ever and ever; <br/>   he will be our guide even to the end. <br/></span>
