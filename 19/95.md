<span class="verse thi_95_1">  <sup>1</sup>Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord; <br/>   let us shout aloud to the Rock of our salvation. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_95_2">  <sup>2</sup>Let us come before him with thanksgiving <br/>   and extol him with music and song. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_95_3">  <sup>3</sup>For the Lord is the great God, <br/>   the great King above all gods. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_95_4">  <sup>4</sup>In his hand are the depths of the earth, <br/>   and the mountain peaks belong to him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_95_5">  <sup>5</sup>The sea is his, for he made it, <br/>   and his hands formed the dry land. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_95_6">  <sup>6</sup>Come, let us bow down in worship, <br/>   let us kneel before the Lord our Maker; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_95_7">  <sup>7</sup>for he is our God <br/>   and we are the people of his pasture, <br/>   the flock under his care. <br/><br/>  Today, if only you would hear his voice, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_95_8">  <sup>8</sup>“Do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means quarreling.">⚓</a><br/>   as you did that day at Massah<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means testing.">⚓</a> in the wilderness, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_95_9">  <sup>9</sup>where your ancestors tested me; <br/>   they tried me, though they had seen what I did. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_95_10">  <sup>10</sup>For forty years I was angry with that generation; <br/>   I said, ‘They are a people whose hearts go astray, <br/>   and they have not known my ways.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_95_11">  <sup>11</sup>So I declared on oath in my anger, <br/>   ‘They shall never enter my rest.’ ” <br/></span>
