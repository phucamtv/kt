<div class="title"><h1>17</h1><i>A prayer of David.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_17_1">  <sup>1</sup>Hear me, Lord, my plea is just; <br/>   listen to my cry. <br/>  Hear my prayer— <br/>   it does not rise from deceitful lips. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_17_2">  <sup>2</sup>Let my vindication come from you; <br/>   may your eyes see what is right. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_17_3">  <sup>3</sup>Though you probe my heart, <br/>   though you examine me at night and test me, <br/>  you will find that I have planned no evil; <br/>   my mouth has not transgressed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_17_4">  <sup>4</sup>Though people tried to bribe me, <br/>   I have kept myself from the ways of the violent <br/>   through what your lips have commanded. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_17_5">  <sup>5</sup>My steps have held to your paths; <br/>   my feet have not stumbled. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_17_6">  <sup>6</sup>I call on you, my God, for you will answer me; <br/>   turn your ear to me and hear my prayer. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_17_7">  <sup>7</sup>Show me the wonders of your great love, <br/>   you who save by your right hand <br/>   those who take refuge in you from their foes. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_17_8">  <sup>8</sup>Keep me as the apple of your eye; <br/>   hide me in the shadow of your wings <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_17_9">  <sup>9</sup>from the wicked who are out to destroy me, <br/>   from my mortal enemies who surround me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_17_10">  <sup>10</sup>They close up their callous hearts, <br/>   and their mouths speak with arrogance. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_17_11">  <sup>11</sup>They have tracked me down, they now surround me, <br/>   with eyes alert, to throw me to the ground. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_17_12">  <sup>12</sup>They are like a lion hungry for prey, <br/>   like a fierce lion crouching in cover. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_17_13">  <sup>13</sup>Rise up, Lord, confront them, bring them down; <br/>   with your sword rescue me from the wicked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_17_14">  <sup>14</sup>By your hand save me from such people, Lord, <br/>   from those of this world whose reward is in this life. <br/>  May what you have stored up for the wicked fill their bellies; <br/>   may their children gorge themselves on it, <br/>   and may there be leftovers for their little ones. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_17_15">  <sup>15</sup>As for me, I will be vindicated and will see your face; <br/>   when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness. <br/></span>
