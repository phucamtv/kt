<span class="verse thi_66_2">   <sup>2</sup>Sing the glory of his name; <br/>   make his praise glorious. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_66_3">  <sup>3</sup>Say to God, “How awesome are your deeds! <br/>   So great is your power <br/>   that your enemies cringe before you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_66_4">  <sup>4</sup>All the earth bows down to you; <br/>   they sing praise to you, <br/>   they sing the praises of your name.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here and at the end of verses 7 and 15.">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_66_5">  <sup>5</sup>Come and see what God has done, <br/>   his awesome deeds for mankind! <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_66_6">  <sup>6</sup>He turned the sea into dry land, <br/>   they passed through the waters on foot— <br/>   come, let us rejoice in him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_66_7">  <sup>7</sup>He rules forever by his power, <br/>   his eyes watch the nations— <br/>   let not the rebellious rise up against him. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_66_8">  <sup>8</sup>Praise our God, all peoples, <br/>   let the sound of his praise be heard; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_66_9">  <sup>9</sup>he has preserved our lives <br/>   and kept our feet from slipping. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_66_10">  <sup>10</sup>For you, God, tested us; <br/>   you refined us like silver. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_66_11">  <sup>11</sup>You brought us into prison <br/>   and laid burdens on our backs. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_66_12">  <sup>12</sup>You let people ride over our heads; <br/>   we went through fire and water, <br/>   but you brought us to a place of abundance. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_66_13">  <sup>13</sup>I will come to your temple with burnt offerings <br/>   and fulfill my vows to you— <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_66_14">  <sup>14</sup>vows my lips promised and my mouth spoke <br/>   when I was in trouble. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_66_15">  <sup>15</sup>I will sacrifice fat animals to you <br/>   and an offering of rams; <br/>   I will offer bulls and goats. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_66_16">  <sup>16</sup>Come and hear, all you who fear God; <br/>   let me tell you what he has done for me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_66_17">  <sup>17</sup>I cried out to him with my mouth; <br/>   his praise was on my tongue. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_66_18">  <sup>18</sup>If I had cherished sin in my heart, <br/>   the Lord would not have listened; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_66_19">  <sup>19</sup>but God has surely listened <br/>   and has heard my prayer. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_66_20">  <sup>20</sup>Praise be to God, <br/>   who has not rejected my prayer <br/>   or withheld his love from me! <br/></span>
