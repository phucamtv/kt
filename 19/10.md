<span class="verse thi_10_1">  <sup>1</sup>Why, Lord, do you stand far off? <br/>   Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_2">  <sup>2</sup>In his arrogance the wicked man hunts down the weak, <br/>   who are caught in the schemes he devises. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_3">  <sup>3</sup>He boasts about the cravings of his heart; <br/>   he blesses the greedy and reviles the Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_4">  <sup>4</sup>In his pride the wicked man does not seek him; <br/>   in all his thoughts there is no room for God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_5">  <sup>5</sup>His ways are always prosperous; <br/>   your laws are rejected by<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="See Septuagint; Hebrew / they are haughty, and your laws are far from">⚓</a> him; <br/>   he sneers at all his enemies. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_6">  <sup>6</sup>He says to himself, “Nothing will ever shake me.” <br/>   He swears, “No one will ever do me harm.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_7">  <sup>7</sup>His mouth is full of lies and threats; <br/>   trouble and evil are under his tongue. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_8">  <sup>8</sup>He lies in wait near the villages; <br/>   from ambush he murders the innocent. <br/>  His eyes watch in secret for his victims; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_9">   <sup>9</sup>like a lion in cover he lies in wait. <br/>  He lies in wait to catch the helpless; <br/>   he catches the helpless and drags them off in his net. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_10">  <sup>10</sup>His victims are crushed, they collapse; <br/>   they fall under his strength. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_11">  <sup>11</sup>He says to himself, “God will never notice; <br/>   he covers his face and never sees.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_12">  <sup>12</sup>Arise, Lord! Lift up your hand, O God. <br/>   Do not forget the helpless. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_13">  <sup>13</sup>Why does the wicked man revile God? <br/>   Why does he say to himself, <br/>   “He won’t call me to account”? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_14">  <sup>14</sup>But you, God, see the trouble of the afflicted; <br/>   you consider their grief and take it in hand. <br/>  The victims commit themselves to you; <br/>   you are the helper of the fatherless. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_15">  <sup>15</sup>Break the arm of the wicked man; <br/>   call the evildoer to account for his wickedness <br/>   that would not otherwise be found out. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_16">  <sup>16</sup>The Lord is King for ever and ever; <br/>   the nations will perish from his land. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_17">  <sup>17</sup>You, Lord, hear the desire of the afflicted; <br/>   you encourage them, and you listen to their cry, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_18">  <sup>18</sup>defending the fatherless and the oppressed, <br/>   so that mere earthly mortals <br/>   will never again strike terror. <br/></span>
