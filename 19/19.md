<span class="verse thi_19_1">  <sup>1</sup>The heavens declare the glory of God; <br/>   the skies proclaim the work of his hands. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_19_2">  <sup>2</sup>Day after day they pour forth speech; <br/>   night after night they reveal knowledge. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_19_3">  <sup>3</sup>They have no speech, they use no words; <br/>   no sound is heard from them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_19_4">  <sup>4</sup>Yet their voice<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint, Jerome and Syriac; Hebrew measuring line">⚓</a> goes out into all the earth, <br/>   their words to the ends of the world. <br/>  In the heavens God has pitched a tent for the sun. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_19_5">   <sup>5</sup>It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, <br/>   like a champion rejoicing to run his course. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_19_6">  <sup>6</sup>It rises at one end of the heavens <br/>   and makes its circuit to the other; <br/>   nothing is deprived of its warmth. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_19_7">  <sup>7</sup>The law of the Lord is perfect, <br/>   refreshing the soul. <br/>  The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy, <br/>   making wise the simple. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_19_8">  <sup>8</sup>The precepts of the Lord are right, <br/>   giving joy to the heart. <br/>  The commands of the Lord are radiant, <br/>   giving light to the eyes. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_19_9">  <sup>9</sup>The fear of the Lord is pure, <br/>   enduring forever. <br/>  The decrees of the Lord are firm, <br/>   and all of them are righteous. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_19_10">  <sup>10</sup>They are more precious than gold, <br/>   than much pure gold; <br/>  they are sweeter than honey, <br/>   than honey from the honeycomb. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_19_11">  <sup>11</sup>By them your servant is warned; <br/>   in keeping them there is great reward. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_19_12">  <sup>12</sup>But who can discern their own errors? <br/>   Forgive my hidden faults. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_19_13">  <sup>13</sup>Keep your servant also from willful sins; <br/>   may they not rule over me. <br/>  Then I will be blameless, <br/>   innocent of great transgression. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_19_14">  <sup>14</sup>May these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart <br/>   be pleasing in your sight, <br/>   Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer. <br/></span>
