<span class="verse thi_124_1">  <sup>1</sup>If the Lord had not been on our side— <br/>   let Israel say— <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_124_2">  <sup>2</sup>if the Lord had not been on our side <br/>   when people attacked us, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_124_3">  <sup>3</sup>they would have swallowed us alive <br/>   when their anger flared against us; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_124_4">  <sup>4</sup>the flood would have engulfed us, <br/>   the torrent would have swept over us, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_124_5">  <sup>5</sup>the raging waters <br/>   would have swept us away. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_124_6">  <sup>6</sup>Praise be to the Lord, <br/>   who has not let us be torn by their teeth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_124_7">  <sup>7</sup>We have escaped like a bird <br/>   from the fowler’s snare; <br/>  the snare has been broken, <br/>   and we have escaped. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_124_8">  <sup>8</sup>Our help is in the name of the Lord, <br/>   the Maker of heaven and earth. <br/></span>
