<span class="verse thi_90_1">  <sup>1</sup>Lord, you have been our dwelling place <br/>   throughout all generations. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_90_2">  <sup>2</sup>Before the mountains were born <br/>   or you brought forth the whole world, <br/>   from everlasting to everlasting you are God. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_90_3">  <sup>3</sup>You turn people back to dust, <br/>   saying, “Return to dust, you mortals.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_90_4">  <sup>4</sup>A thousand years in your sight <br/>   are like a day that has just gone by, <br/>   or like a watch in the night. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_90_5">  <sup>5</sup>Yet you sweep people away in the sleep of death— <br/>   they are like the new grass of the morning: <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_90_6">  <sup>6</sup>In the morning it springs up new, <br/>   but by evening it is dry and withered. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_90_7">  <sup>7</sup>We are consumed by your anger <br/>   and terrified by your indignation. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_90_8">  <sup>8</sup>You have set our iniquities before you, <br/>   our secret sins in the light of your presence. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_90_9">  <sup>9</sup>All our days pass away under your wrath; <br/>   we finish our years with a moan. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_90_10">  <sup>10</sup>Our days may come to seventy years, <br/>   or eighty, if our strength endures; <br/>  yet the best of them are but trouble and sorrow, <br/>   for they quickly pass, and we fly away. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_90_11">  <sup>11</sup>If only we knew the power of your anger! <br/>   Your wrath is as great as the fear that is your due. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_90_12">  <sup>12</sup>Teach us to number our days, <br/>   that we may gain a heart of wisdom. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_90_13">  <sup>13</sup>Relent, Lord! How long will it be? <br/>   Have compassion on your servants. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_90_14">  <sup>14</sup>Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, <br/>   that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_90_15">  <sup>15</sup>Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, <br/>   for as many years as we have seen trouble. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_90_16">  <sup>16</sup>May your deeds be shown to your servants, <br/>   your splendor to their children. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_90_17">  <sup>17</sup>May the favor<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or beauty">⚓</a> of the Lord our God rest on us; <br/>   establish the work of our hands for us— <br/>   yes, establish the work of our hands. <br/></span>
