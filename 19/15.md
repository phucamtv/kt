<div class="title"><h1>15</h1><i>A psalm of David.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_15_1">  <sup>1</sup>Lord, who may dwell in your sacred tent? <br/>   Who may live on your holy mountain? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_15_2">  <sup>2</sup>The one whose walk is blameless, <br/>   who does what is righteous, <br/>   who speaks the truth from their heart; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_15_3">  <sup>3</sup>whose tongue utters no slander, <br/>   who does no wrong to a neighbor, <br/>   and casts no slur on others; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_15_4">  <sup>4</sup>who despises a vile person <br/>   but honors those who fear the Lord; <br/>  who keeps an oath even when it hurts, <br/>   and does not change their mind; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_15_5">  <sup>5</sup>who lends money to the poor without interest; <br/>   who does not accept a bribe against the innocent. <br/><br/>  Whoever does these things <br/>   will never be shaken. <br/></span>
