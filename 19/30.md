<div class="title"><h1>30</h1><i>A psalm. A song. For the dedication of the temple.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Title: Or palace">⚓</a> Of David.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_30_1">  <sup>1</sup>I will exalt you, Lord, <br/>   for you lifted me out of the depths <br/>   and did not let my enemies gloat over me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_30_2">  <sup>2</sup>Lord my God, I called to you for help, <br/>   and you healed me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_30_3">  <sup>3</sup>You, Lord, brought me up from the realm of the dead; <br/>   you spared me from going down to the pit. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_30_4">  <sup>4</sup>Sing the praises of the Lord, you his faithful people; <br/>   praise his holy name. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_30_5">  <sup>5</sup>For his anger lasts only a moment, <br/>   but his favor lasts a lifetime; <br/>  weeping may stay for the night, <br/>   but rejoicing comes in the morning. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_30_6">  <sup>6</sup>When I felt secure, I said, <br/>   “I will never be shaken.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_30_7">  <sup>7</sup>Lord, when you favored me, <br/>   you made my royal mountain<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, Mount Zion">⚓</a> stand firm; <br/>  but when you hid your face, <br/>   I was dismayed. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_30_8">  <sup>8</sup>To you, Lord, I called; <br/>   to the Lord I cried for mercy: <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_30_9">  <sup>9</sup>“What is gained if I am silenced, <br/>   if I go down to the pit? <br/>  Will the dust praise you? <br/>   Will it proclaim your faithfulness? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_30_10">  <sup>10</sup>Hear, Lord, and be merciful to me; <br/>   Lord, be my help.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_30_11">  <sup>11</sup>You turned my wailing into dancing; <br/>   you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_30_12">  <sup>12</sup>that my heart may sing your praises and not be silent. <br/>   Lord my God, I will praise you forever. <br/></span>
