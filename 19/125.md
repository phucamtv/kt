<span class="verse thi_125_1">  <sup>1</sup>Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, <br/>   which cannot be shaken but endures forever. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_125_2">  <sup>2</sup>As the mountains surround Jerusalem, <br/>   so the Lord surrounds his people <br/>   both now and forevermore. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_125_3">  <sup>3</sup>The scepter of the wicked will not remain <br/>   over the land allotted to the righteous, <br/>  for then the righteous might use <br/>   their hands to do evil. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_125_4">  <sup>4</sup>Lord, do good to those who are good, <br/>   to those who are upright in heart. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_125_5">  <sup>5</sup>But those who turn to crooked ways <br/>   the Lord will banish with the evildoers. <br/><br/>  Peace be on Israel. <br/></span>
