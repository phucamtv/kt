<span class="verse thi_37_1">  <sup>1</sup>Do not fret because of those who are evil <br/>   or be envious of those who do wrong; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_2">  <sup>2</sup>for like the grass they will soon wither, <br/>   like green plants they will soon die away. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_3">  <sup>3</sup>Trust in the Lord and do good; <br/>   dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_4">  <sup>4</sup>Take delight in the Lord, <br/>   and he will give you the desires of your heart. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_5">  <sup>5</sup>Commit your way to the Lord; <br/>   trust in him and he will do this: <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_6">  <sup>6</sup>He will make your righteous reward shine like the dawn, <br/>   your vindication like the noonday sun. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_7">  <sup>7</sup>Be still before the Lord<br/>   and wait patiently for him; <br/>  do not fret when people succeed in their ways, <br/>   when they carry out their wicked schemes. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_8">  <sup>8</sup>Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; <br/>   do not fret—it leads only to evil. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_9">  <sup>9</sup>For those who are evil will be destroyed, <br/>   but those who hope in the Lord will inherit the land. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_10">  <sup>10</sup>A little while, and the wicked will be no more; <br/>   though you look for them, they will not be found. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_11">  <sup>11</sup>But the meek will inherit the land <br/>   and enjoy peace and prosperity. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_12">  <sup>12</sup>The wicked plot against the righteous <br/>   and gnash their teeth at them; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_13">  <sup>13</sup>but the Lord laughs at the wicked, <br/>   for he knows their day is coming. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_14">  <sup>14</sup>The wicked draw the sword <br/>   and bend the bow <br/>  to bring down the poor and needy, <br/>   to slay those whose ways are upright. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_15">  <sup>15</sup>But their swords will pierce their own hearts, <br/>   and their bows will be broken. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_16">  <sup>16</sup>Better the little that the righteous have <br/>   than the wealth of many wicked; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_17">  <sup>17</sup>for the power of the wicked will be broken, <br/>   but the Lord upholds the righteous. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_18">  <sup>18</sup>The blameless spend their days under the Lord’s care, <br/>   and their inheritance will endure forever. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_19">  <sup>19</sup>In times of disaster they will not wither; <br/>   in days of famine they will enjoy plenty. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_20">  <sup>20</sup>But the wicked will perish: <br/>   Though the Lord’s enemies are like the flowers of the field, <br/>   they will be consumed, they will go up in smoke. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_21">  <sup>21</sup>The wicked borrow and do not repay, <br/>   but the righteous give generously; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_22">  <sup>22</sup>those the Lord blesses will inherit the land, <br/>   but those he curses will be destroyed. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_23">  <sup>23</sup>The Lord makes firm the steps <br/>   of the one who delights in him; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_24">  <sup>24</sup>though he may stumble, he will not fall, <br/>   for the Lord upholds him with his hand. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_25">  <sup>25</sup>I was young and now I am old, <br/>   yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken <br/>   or their children begging bread. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_26">  <sup>26</sup>They are always generous and lend freely; <br/>   their children will be a blessing.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or freely; / the names of their children will be used in blessings (see Gen. 48:20); or freely; / others will see that their children are blessed">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_27">  <sup>27</sup>Turn from evil and do good; <br/>   then you will dwell in the land forever. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_28">  <sup>28</sup>For the Lord loves the just <br/>   and will not forsake his faithful ones. <br/><br/>  Wrongdoers will be completely destroyed<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="See Septuagint; Hebrew They will be protected forever">⚓</a> ; <br/>   the offspring of the wicked will perish. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_29">  <sup>29</sup>The righteous will inherit the land <br/>   and dwell in it forever. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_30">  <sup>30</sup>The mouths of the righteous utter wisdom, <br/>   and their tongues speak what is just. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_31">  <sup>31</sup>The law of their God is in their hearts; <br/>   their feet do not slip. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_32">  <sup>32</sup>The wicked lie in wait for the righteous, <br/>   intent on putting them to death; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_33">  <sup>33</sup>but the Lord will not leave them in the power of the wicked <br/>   or let them be condemned when brought to trial. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_34">  <sup>34</sup>Hope in the Lord<br/>   and keep his way. <br/>  He will exalt you to inherit the land; <br/>   when the wicked are destroyed, you will see it. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_35">  <sup>35</sup>I have seen a wicked and ruthless man <br/>   flourishing like a luxuriant native tree, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_36">  <sup>36</sup>but he soon passed away and was no more; <br/>   though I looked for him, he could not be found. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_37">  <sup>37</sup>Consider the blameless, observe the upright; <br/>   a future awaits those who seek peace.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or upright; / those who seek peace will have posterity">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_38">  <sup>38</sup>But all sinners will be destroyed; <br/>   there will be no future<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or posterity">⚓</a> for the wicked. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_39">  <sup>39</sup>The salvation of the righteous comes from the Lord; <br/>   he is their stronghold in time of trouble. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_37_40">  <sup>40</sup>The Lord helps them and delivers them; <br/>   he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, <br/>   because they take refuge in him. <br/></span>
