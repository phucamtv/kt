<span class="verse thi_73_1">  <sup>1</sup>Surely God is good to Israel, <br/>   to those who are pure in heart. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_2">  <sup>2</sup>But as for me, my feet had almost slipped; <br/>   I had nearly lost my foothold. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_3">  <sup>3</sup>For I envied the arrogant <br/>   when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_4">  <sup>4</sup>They have no struggles; <br/>   their bodies are healthy and strong.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="With a different word division of the Hebrew; Masoretic Text struggles at their death; / their bodies are healthy">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_5">  <sup>5</sup>They are free from common human burdens; <br/>   they are not plagued by human ills. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_6">  <sup>6</sup>Therefore pride is their necklace; <br/>   they clothe themselves with violence. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_7">  <sup>7</sup>From their callous hearts comes iniquity<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Syriac (see also Septuagint); Hebrew Their eyes bulge with fat">⚓</a> ; <br/>   their evil imaginations have no limits. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_8">  <sup>8</sup>They scoff, and speak with malice; <br/>   with arrogance they threaten oppression. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_9">  <sup>9</sup>Their mouths lay claim to heaven, <br/>   and their tongues take possession of the earth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_10">  <sup>10</sup>Therefore their people turn to them <br/>   and drink up waters in abundance.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this verse is uncertain.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_11">  <sup>11</sup>They say, “How would God know? <br/>   Does the Most High know anything?” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_12">  <sup>12</sup>This is what the wicked are like— <br/>   always free of care, they go on amassing wealth. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_13">  <sup>13</sup>Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure <br/>   and have washed my hands in innocence. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_14">  <sup>14</sup>All day long I have been afflicted, <br/>   and every morning brings new punishments. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_15">  <sup>15</sup>If I had spoken out like that, <br/>   I would have betrayed your children. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_16">  <sup>16</sup>When I tried to understand all this, <br/>   it troubled me deeply <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_17">  <sup>17</sup>till I entered the sanctuary of God; <br/>   then I understood their final destiny. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_18">  <sup>18</sup>Surely you place them on slippery ground; <br/>   you cast them down to ruin. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_19">  <sup>19</sup>How suddenly are they destroyed, <br/>   completely swept away by terrors! <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_20">  <sup>20</sup>They are like a dream when one awakes; <br/>   when you arise, Lord, <br/>   you will despise them as fantasies. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_21">  <sup>21</sup>When my heart was grieved <br/>   and my spirit embittered, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_22">  <sup>22</sup>I was senseless and ignorant; <br/>   I was a brute beast before you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_23">  <sup>23</sup>Yet I am always with you; <br/>   you hold me by my right hand. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_24">  <sup>24</sup>You guide me with your counsel, <br/>   and afterward you will take me into glory. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_25">  <sup>25</sup>Whom have I in heaven but you? <br/>   And earth has nothing I desire besides you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_26">  <sup>26</sup>My flesh and my heart may fail, <br/>   but God is the strength of my heart <br/>   and my portion forever. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_27">  <sup>27</sup>Those who are far from you will perish; <br/>   you destroy all who are unfaithful to you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_73_28">  <sup>28</sup>But as for me, it is good to be near God. <br/>   I have made the Sovereign Lord my refuge; <br/>   I will tell of all your deeds. <br/></span>
