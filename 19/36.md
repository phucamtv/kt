<span class="verse thi_36_1">  <sup>1</sup>I have a message from God in my heart <br/>   concerning the sinfulness of the wicked:<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or A message from God: The transgression of the wicked / resides in their hearts.">⚓</a><br/>  There is no fear of God <br/>   before their eyes. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_36_2">  <sup>2</sup>In their own eyes they flatter themselves <br/>   too much to detect or hate their sin. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_36_3">  <sup>3</sup>The words of their mouths are wicked and deceitful; <br/>   they fail to act wisely or do good. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_36_4">  <sup>4</sup>Even on their beds they plot evil; <br/>   they commit themselves to a sinful course <br/>   and do not reject what is wrong. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_36_5">  <sup>5</sup>Your love, Lord, reaches to the heavens, <br/>   your faithfulness to the skies. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_36_6">  <sup>6</sup>Your righteousness is like the highest mountains, <br/>   your justice like the great deep. <br/>   You, Lord, preserve both people and animals. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_36_7">  <sup>7</sup>How priceless is your unfailing love, O God! <br/>   People take refuge in the shadow of your wings. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_36_8">  <sup>8</sup>They feast on the abundance of your house; <br/>   you give them drink from your river of delights. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_36_9">  <sup>9</sup>For with you is the fountain of life; <br/>   in your light we see light. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_36_10">  <sup>10</sup>Continue your love to those who know you, <br/>   your righteousness to the upright in heart. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_36_11">  <sup>11</sup>May the foot of the proud not come against me, <br/>   nor the hand of the wicked drive me away. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_36_12">  <sup>12</sup>See how the evildoers lie fallen— <br/>   thrown down, not able to rise! <br/></span>
