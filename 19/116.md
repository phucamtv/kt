<span class="verse thi_116_3">  <sup>3</sup>The cords of death entangled me, <br/>   the anguish of the grave came over me; <br/>   I was overcome by distress and sorrow. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_116_4">  <sup>4</sup>Then I called on the name of the Lord: <br/>   “Lord, save me!” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_116_5">  <sup>5</sup>The Lord is gracious and righteous; <br/>   our God is full of compassion. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_116_6">  <sup>6</sup>The Lord protects the unwary; <br/>   when I was brought low, he saved me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_116_7">  <sup>7</sup>Return to your rest, my soul, <br/>   for the Lord has been good to you. <br/><br/></span>

<span class="verse thi_116_9">  <sup>9</sup>that I may walk before the Lord<br/>   in the land of the living. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_116_10">  <sup>10</sup>I trusted in the Lord when I said, <br/>   “I am greatly afflicted”; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_116_11">  <sup>11</sup>in my alarm I said, <br/>   “Everyone is a liar.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_116_12">  <sup>12</sup>What shall I return to the Lord<br/>   for all his goodness to me? <br/><br/></span>

<span class="verse thi_116_14">  <sup>14</sup>I will fulfill my vows to the Lord<br/>   in the presence of all his people. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_116_15">  <sup>15</sup>Precious in the sight of the Lord<br/>   is the death of his faithful servants. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_116_16">  <sup>16</sup>Truly I am your servant, Lord; <br/>   I serve you just as my mother did; <br/>   you have freed me from my chains. <br/><br/></span>
