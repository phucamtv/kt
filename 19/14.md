<span class="verse thi_14_1">  <sup>1</sup>The fool<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew words rendered fool in Psalms denote one who is morally deficient.">⚓</a> says in his heart, <br/>   “There is no God.” <br/>  They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; <br/>   there is no one who does good. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_14_2">  <sup>2</sup>The Lord looks down from heaven <br/>   on all mankind <br/>  to see if there are any who understand, <br/>   any who seek God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_14_3">  <sup>3</sup>All have turned away, all have become corrupt; <br/>   there is no one who does good, <br/>   not even one. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_14_4">  <sup>4</sup>Do all these evildoers know nothing? <br/><br/>  They devour my people as though eating bread; <br/>   they never call on the Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_14_5">  <sup>5</sup>But there they are, overwhelmed with dread, <br/>   for God is present in the company of the righteous. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_14_6">  <sup>6</sup>You evildoers frustrate the plans of the poor, <br/>   but the Lord is their refuge. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_14_7">  <sup>7</sup>Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! <br/>   When the Lord restores his people, <br/>   let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad! <br/></span>
