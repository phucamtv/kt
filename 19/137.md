<span class="verse thi_137_1">  <sup>1</sup>By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept <br/>   when we remembered Zion. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_137_2">  <sup>2</sup>There on the poplars <br/>   we hung our harps, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_137_3">  <sup>3</sup>for there our captors asked us for songs, <br/>   our tormentors demanded songs of joy; <br/>   they said, “Sing us one of the songs of Zion!” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_137_4">  <sup>4</sup>How can we sing the songs of the Lord<br/>   while in a foreign land? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_137_5">  <sup>5</sup>If I forget you, Jerusalem, <br/>   may my right hand forget its skill. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_137_6">  <sup>6</sup>May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth <br/>   if I do not remember you, <br/>  if I do not consider Jerusalem <br/>   my highest joy. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_137_7">  <sup>7</sup>Remember, Lord, what the Edomites did <br/>   on the day Jerusalem fell. <br/>  “Tear it down,” they cried, <br/>   “tear it down to its foundations!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_137_8">  <sup>8</sup>Daughter Babylon, doomed to destruction, <br/>   happy is the one who repays you <br/>   according to what you have done to us. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_137_9">  <sup>9</sup>Happy is the one who seizes your infants <br/>   and dashes them against the rocks. <br/></span>
