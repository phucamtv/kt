<span class="verse thi_27_1">  <sup>1</sup>The Lord is my light and my salvation— <br/>   whom shall I fear? <br/>  The Lord is the stronghold of my life— <br/>   of whom shall I be afraid? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_27_2">  <sup>2</sup>When the wicked advance against me <br/>   to devour<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or slander">⚓</a> me, <br/>  it is my enemies and my foes <br/>   who will stumble and fall. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_27_3">  <sup>3</sup>Though an army besiege me, <br/>   my heart will not fear; <br/>  though war break out against me, <br/>   even then I will be confident. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_27_4">  <sup>4</sup>One thing I ask from the Lord, <br/>   this only do I seek: <br/>  that I may dwell in the house of the Lord<br/>   all the days of my life, <br/>  to gaze on the beauty of the Lord<br/>   and to seek him in his temple. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_27_5">  <sup>5</sup>For in the day of trouble <br/>   he will keep me safe in his dwelling; <br/>  he will hide me in the shelter of his sacred tent <br/>   and set me high upon a rock. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_27_6">  <sup>6</sup>Then my head will be exalted <br/>   above the enemies who surround me; <br/>  at his sacred tent I will sacrifice with shouts of joy; <br/>   I will sing and make music to the Lord. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_27_7">  <sup>7</sup>Hear my voice when I call, Lord; <br/>   be merciful to me and answer me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_27_8">  <sup>8</sup>My heart says of you, “Seek his face!” <br/>   Your face, Lord, I will seek. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_27_9">  <sup>9</sup>Do not hide your face from me, <br/>   do not turn your servant away in anger; <br/>   you have been my helper. <br/>  Do not reject me or forsake me, <br/>   God my Savior. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_27_10">  <sup>10</sup>Though my father and mother forsake me, <br/>   the Lord will receive me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_27_11">  <sup>11</sup>Teach me your way, Lord; <br/>   lead me in a straight path <br/>   because of my oppressors. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_27_12">  <sup>12</sup>Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes, <br/>   for false witnesses rise up against me, <br/>   spouting malicious accusations. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_27_13">  <sup>13</sup>I remain confident of this: <br/>   I will see the goodness of the Lord<br/>   in the land of the living. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_27_14">  <sup>14</sup>Wait for the Lord; <br/>   be strong and take heart <br/>   and wait for the Lord. <br/></span>
