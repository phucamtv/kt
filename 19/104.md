<span class="verse thi_104_1">  <sup>1</sup>Praise the Lord, my soul. <br/><br/>  Lord my God, you are very great; <br/>   you are clothed with splendor and majesty. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_2">  <sup>2</sup>The Lord wraps himself in light as with a garment; <br/>   he stretches out the heavens like a tent <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_3">   <sup>3</sup>and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters. <br/>  He makes the clouds his chariot <br/>   and rides on the wings of the wind. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_4">  <sup>4</sup>He makes winds his messengers,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or angels">⚓</a><br/>   flames of fire his servants. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_5">  <sup>5</sup>He set the earth on its foundations; <br/>   it can never be moved. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_6">  <sup>6</sup>You covered it with the watery depths as with a garment; <br/>   the waters stood above the mountains. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_7">  <sup>7</sup>But at your rebuke the waters fled, <br/>   at the sound of your thunder they took to flight; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_8">  <sup>8</sup>they flowed over the mountains, <br/>   they went down into the valleys, <br/>   to the place you assigned for them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_9">  <sup>9</sup>You set a boundary they cannot cross; <br/>   never again will they cover the earth. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_10">  <sup>10</sup>He makes springs pour water into the ravines; <br/>   it flows between the mountains. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_11">  <sup>11</sup>They give water to all the beasts of the field; <br/>   the wild donkeys quench their thirst. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_12">  <sup>12</sup>The birds of the sky nest by the waters; <br/>   they sing among the branches. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_13">  <sup>13</sup>He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; <br/>   the land is satisfied by the fruit of his work. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_14">  <sup>14</sup>He makes grass grow for the cattle, <br/>   and plants for people to cultivate— <br/>   bringing forth food from the earth: <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_15">  <sup>15</sup>wine that gladdens human hearts, <br/>   oil to make their faces shine, <br/>   and bread that sustains their hearts. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_16">  <sup>16</sup>The trees of the Lord are well watered, <br/>   the cedars of Lebanon that he planted. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_17">  <sup>17</sup>There the birds make their nests; <br/>   the stork has its home in the junipers. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_18">  <sup>18</sup>The high mountains belong to the wild goats; <br/>   the crags are a refuge for the hyrax. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_19">  <sup>19</sup>He made the moon to mark the seasons, <br/>   and the sun knows when to go down. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_20">  <sup>20</sup>You bring darkness, it becomes night, <br/>   and all the beasts of the forest prowl. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_21">  <sup>21</sup>The lions roar for their prey <br/>   and seek their food from God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_22">  <sup>22</sup>The sun rises, and they steal away; <br/>   they return and lie down in their dens. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_23">  <sup>23</sup>Then people go out to their work, <br/>   to their labor until evening. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_24">  <sup>24</sup>How many are your works, Lord! <br/>   In wisdom you made them all; <br/>   the earth is full of your creatures. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_25">  <sup>25</sup>There is the sea, vast and spacious, <br/>   teeming with creatures beyond number— <br/>   living things both large and small. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_26">  <sup>26</sup>There the ships go to and fro, <br/>   and Leviathan, which you formed to frolic there. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_27">  <sup>27</sup>All creatures look to you <br/>   to give them their food at the proper time. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_28">  <sup>28</sup>When you give it to them, <br/>   they gather it up; <br/>  when you open your hand, <br/>   they are satisfied with good things. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_29">  <sup>29</sup>When you hide your face, <br/>   they are terrified; <br/>  when you take away their breath, <br/>   they die and return to the dust. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_30">  <sup>30</sup>When you send your Spirit, <br/>   they are created, <br/>   and you renew the face of the ground. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_31">  <sup>31</sup>May the glory of the Lord endure forever; <br/>   may the Lord rejoice in his works— <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_32">  <sup>32</sup>he who looks at the earth, and it trembles, <br/>   who touches the mountains, and they smoke. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_33">  <sup>33</sup>I will sing to the Lord all my life; <br/>   I will sing praise to my God as long as I live. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_34">  <sup>34</sup>May my meditation be pleasing to him, <br/>   as I rejoice in the Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_104_35">  <sup>35</sup>But may sinners vanish from the earth <br/>   and the wicked be no more. <br/><br/>  Praise the Lord, my soul. <br/><br/>  Praise the Lord.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew Hallelu Yah ; in the Septuagint this line stands at the beginning of Psalm 105.">⚓</a><br/></span>
