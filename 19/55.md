<span class="verse thi_55_1">  <sup>1</sup>Listen to my prayer, O God, <br/>   do not ignore my plea; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_2">   <sup>2</sup>hear me and answer me. <br/>  My thoughts trouble me and I am distraught <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_3">   <sup>3</sup>because of what my enemy is saying, <br/>   because of the threats of the wicked; <br/>  for they bring down suffering on me <br/>   and assail me in their anger. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_4">  <sup>4</sup>My heart is in anguish within me; <br/>   the terrors of death have fallen on me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_5">  <sup>5</sup>Fear and trembling have beset me; <br/>   horror has overwhelmed me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_6">  <sup>6</sup>I said, “Oh, that I had the wings of a dove! <br/>   I would fly away and be at rest. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_7">  <sup>7</sup>I would flee far away <br/>   and stay in the desert;<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here and in the middle of verse 19.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_8">  <sup>8</sup>I would hurry to my place of shelter, <br/>   far from the tempest and storm.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_9">  <sup>9</sup>Lord, confuse the wicked, confound their words, <br/>   for I see violence and strife in the city. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_10">  <sup>10</sup>Day and night they prowl about on its walls; <br/>   malice and abuse are within it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_11">  <sup>11</sup>Destructive forces are at work in the city; <br/>   threats and lies never leave its streets. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_12">  <sup>12</sup>If an enemy were insulting me, <br/>   I could endure it; <br/>  if a foe were rising against me, <br/>   I could hide. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_13">  <sup>13</sup>But it is you, a man like myself, <br/>   my companion, my close friend, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_14">  <sup>14</sup>with whom I once enjoyed sweet fellowship <br/>   at the house of God, <br/>  as we walked about <br/>   among the worshipers. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_15">  <sup>15</sup>Let death take my enemies by surprise; <br/>   let them go down alive to the realm of the dead, <br/>   for evil finds lodging among them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_16">  <sup>16</sup>As for me, I call to God, <br/>   and the Lord saves me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_17">  <sup>17</sup>Evening, morning and noon <br/>   I cry out in distress, <br/>   and he hears my voice. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_18">  <sup>18</sup>He rescues me unharmed <br/>   from the battle waged against me, <br/>   even though many oppose me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_19">  <sup>19</sup>God, who is enthroned from of old, <br/>   who does not change— <br/>  he will hear them and humble them, <br/>   because they have no fear of God. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_20">  <sup>20</sup>My companion attacks his friends; <br/>   he violates his covenant. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_21">  <sup>21</sup>His talk is smooth as butter, <br/>   yet war is in his heart; <br/>  his words are more soothing than oil, <br/>   yet they are drawn swords. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_22">  <sup>22</sup>Cast your cares on the Lord<br/>   and he will sustain you; <br/>  he will never let <br/>   the righteous be shaken. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_55_23">  <sup>23</sup>But you, God, will bring down the wicked <br/>   into the pit of decay; <br/>  the bloodthirsty and deceitful <br/>   will not live out half their days. <br/><br/>  But as for me, I trust in you. <br/></span>
