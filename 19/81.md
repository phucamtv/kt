<span class="verse thi_81_1">  <sup>1</sup>Sing for joy to God our strength; <br/>   shout aloud to the God of Jacob! <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_81_2">  <sup>2</sup>Begin the music, strike the timbrel, <br/>   play the melodious harp and lyre. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_81_3">  <sup>3</sup>Sound the ram’s horn at the New Moon, <br/>   and when the moon is full, on the day of our festival; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_81_4">  <sup>4</sup>this is a decree for Israel, <br/>   an ordinance of the God of Jacob. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_81_5">  <sup>5</sup>When God went out against Egypt, <br/>   he established it as a statute for Joseph. <br/><br/>  I heard an unknown voice say: <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_81_6">  <sup>6</sup>“I removed the burden from their shoulders; <br/>   their hands were set free from the basket. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_81_7">  <sup>7</sup>In your distress you called and I rescued you, <br/>   I answered you out of a thundercloud; <br/>   I tested you at the waters of Meribah.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_81_8">  <sup>8</sup>Hear me, my people, and I will warn you— <br/>   if you would only listen to me, Israel! <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_81_9">  <sup>9</sup>You shall have no foreign god among you; <br/>   you shall not worship any god other than me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_81_10">  <sup>10</sup>I am the Lord your God, <br/>   who brought you up out of Egypt. <br/>  Open wide your mouth and I will fill it. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_81_11">  <sup>11</sup>“But my people would not listen to me; <br/>   Israel would not submit to me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_81_12">  <sup>12</sup>So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts <br/>   to follow their own devices. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_81_13">  <sup>13</sup>“If my people would only listen to me, <br/>   if Israel would only follow my ways, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_81_14">  <sup>14</sup>how quickly I would subdue their enemies <br/>   and turn my hand against their foes! <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_81_15">  <sup>15</sup>Those who hate the Lord would cringe before him, <br/>   and their punishment would last forever. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_81_16">  <sup>16</sup>But you would be fed with the finest of wheat; <br/>   with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.” <br/></span>
