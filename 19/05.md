<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><i>For the director of music. For pipes. A psalm of David.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_5_1">  <sup>1</sup>Listen to my words, Lord, <br/>   consider my lament. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_5_2">  <sup>2</sup>Hear my cry for help, <br/>   my King and my God, <br/>   for to you I pray. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_5_3">  <sup>3</sup>In the morning, Lord, you hear my voice; <br/>   in the morning I lay my requests before you <br/>   and wait expectantly. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_5_4">  <sup>4</sup>For you are not a God who is pleased with wickedness; <br/>   with you, evil people are not welcome. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_5_5">  <sup>5</sup>The arrogant cannot stand <br/>   in your presence. <br/>  You hate all who do wrong; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_5_6">   <sup>6</sup>you destroy those who tell lies. <br/>  The bloodthirsty and deceitful <br/>   you, Lord, detest. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_5_7">  <sup>7</sup>But I, by your great love, <br/>   can come into your house; <br/>  in reverence I bow down <br/>   toward your holy temple. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_5_8">  <sup>8</sup>Lead me, Lord, in your righteousness <br/>   because of my enemies— <br/>   make your way straight before me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_5_9">  <sup>9</sup>Not a word from their mouth can be trusted; <br/>   their heart is filled with malice. <br/>  Their throat is an open grave; <br/>   with their tongues they tell lies. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_5_10">  <sup>10</sup>Declare them guilty, O God! <br/>   Let their intrigues be their downfall. <br/>  Banish them for their many sins, <br/>   for they have rebelled against you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_5_11">  <sup>11</sup>But let all who take refuge in you be glad; <br/>   let them ever sing for joy. <br/>  Spread your protection over them, <br/>   that those who love your name may rejoice in you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_5_12">  <sup>12</sup>Surely, Lord, you bless the righteous; <br/>   you surround them with your favor as with a shield. <br/></span>
