<div class="title"><h1>133</h1><i>A song of ascents. Of David.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_133_1">  <sup>1</sup>How good and pleasant it is <br/>   when God’s people live together in unity! <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_133_2">  <sup>2</sup>It is like precious oil poured on the head, <br/>   running down on the beard, <br/>  running down on Aaron’s beard, <br/>   down on the collar of his robe. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_133_3">  <sup>3</sup>It is as if the dew of Hermon <br/>   were falling on Mount Zion. <br/>  For there the Lord bestows his blessing, <br/>   even life forevermore. <br/></span>
