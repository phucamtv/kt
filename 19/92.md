<div class="title"><h1>92</h1><i>A psalm. A song. For the Sabbath day.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_92_1">  <sup>1</sup>It is good to praise the Lord<br/>   and make music to your name, O Most High, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_92_2">  <sup>2</sup>proclaiming your love in the morning <br/>   and your faithfulness at night, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_92_3">  <sup>3</sup>to the music of the ten-stringed lyre <br/>   and the melody of the harp. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_92_4">  <sup>4</sup>For you make me glad by your deeds, Lord; <br/>   I sing for joy at what your hands have done. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_92_5">  <sup>5</sup>How great are your works, Lord, <br/>   how profound your thoughts! <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_92_6">  <sup>6</sup>Senseless people do not know, <br/>   fools do not understand, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_92_7">  <sup>7</sup>that though the wicked spring up like grass <br/>   and all evildoers flourish, <br/>   they will be destroyed forever. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_92_8">  <sup>8</sup>But you, Lord, are forever exalted. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_92_9">  <sup>9</sup>For surely your enemies, Lord, <br/>   surely your enemies will perish; <br/>   all evildoers will be scattered. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_92_10">  <sup>10</sup>You have exalted my horn<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="here symbolizes strength.">⚓</a> like that of a wild ox; <br/>   fine oils have been poured on me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_92_11">  <sup>11</sup>My eyes have seen the defeat of my adversaries; <br/>   my ears have heard the rout of my wicked foes. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_92_12">  <sup>12</sup>The righteous will flourish like a palm tree, <br/>   they will grow like a cedar of Lebanon; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_92_13">  <sup>13</sup>planted in the house of the Lord, <br/>   they will flourish in the courts of our God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_92_14">  <sup>14</sup>They will still bear fruit in old age, <br/>   they will stay fresh and green, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_92_15">  <sup>15</sup>proclaiming, “The Lord is upright; <br/>   he is my Rock, and there is no wickedness in him.” <br/></span>
