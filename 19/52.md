<span class="verse thi_52_1">  <sup>1</sup>Why do you boast of evil, you mighty hero? <br/>   Why do you boast all day long, <br/>   you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_52_2">  <sup>2</sup>You who practice deceit, <br/>   your tongue plots destruction; <br/>   it is like a sharpened razor. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_52_3">  <sup>3</sup>You love evil rather than good, <br/>   falsehood rather than speaking the truth.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here and at the end of verse 5.">⚓</a><br/></span>
