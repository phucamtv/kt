<span class="verse thi_12_1">  <sup>1</sup>Help, Lord, for no one is faithful anymore; <br/>   those who are loyal have vanished from the human race. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_12_2">  <sup>2</sup>Everyone lies to their neighbor; <br/>   they flatter with their lips <br/>   but harbor deception in their hearts. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_12_3">  <sup>3</sup>May the Lord silence all flattering lips <br/>   and every boastful tongue— <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_12_4">  <sup>4</sup>those who say, <br/>   “By our tongues we will prevail; <br/>   our own lips will defend us—who is lord over us?” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_12_5">  <sup>5</sup>“Because the poor are plundered and the needy groan, <br/>   I will now arise,” says the Lord. <br/>   “I will protect them from those who malign them.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_12_6">  <sup>6</sup>And the words of the Lord are flawless, <br/>   like silver purified in a crucible, <br/>   like gold<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Probable reading of the original Hebrew text; Masoretic Text earth">⚓</a> refined seven times. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_12_7">  <sup>7</sup>You, Lord, will keep the needy safe <br/>   and will protect us forever from the wicked, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_12_8">  <sup>8</sup>who freely strut about <br/>   when what is vile is honored by the human race. <br/></span>
