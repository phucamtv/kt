<div class="title"><h1>69</h1><i>For the director of music. To the tune of “Lilies.” Of David.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_69_1">  <sup>1</sup>Save me, O God, <br/>   for the waters have come up to my neck. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_2">  <sup>2</sup>I sink in the miry depths, <br/>   where there is no foothold. <br/>  I have come into the deep waters; <br/>   the floods engulf me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_3">  <sup>3</sup>I am worn out calling for help; <br/>   my throat is parched. <br/>  My eyes fail, <br/>   looking for my God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_4">  <sup>4</sup>Those who hate me without reason <br/>   outnumber the hairs of my head; <br/>  many are my enemies without cause, <br/>   those who seek to destroy me. <br/>  I am forced to restore <br/>   what I did not steal. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_5">  <sup>5</sup>You, God, know my folly; <br/>   my guilt is not hidden from you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_6">  <sup>6</sup>Lord, the Lord Almighty, <br/>   may those who hope in you <br/>   not be disgraced because of me; <br/>  God of Israel, <br/>   may those who seek you <br/>   not be put to shame because of me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_7">  <sup>7</sup>For I endure scorn for your sake, <br/>   and shame covers my face. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_8">  <sup>8</sup>I am a foreigner to my own family, <br/>   a stranger to my own mother’s children; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_9">  <sup>9</sup>for zeal for your house consumes me, <br/>   and the insults of those who insult you fall on me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_10">  <sup>10</sup>When I weep and fast, <br/>   I must endure scorn; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_11">  <sup>11</sup>when I put on sackcloth, <br/>   people make sport of me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_12">  <sup>12</sup>Those who sit at the gate mock me, <br/>   and I am the song of the drunkards. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_13">  <sup>13</sup>But I pray to you, Lord, <br/>   in the time of your favor; <br/>  in your great love, O God, <br/>   answer me with your sure salvation. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_14">  <sup>14</sup>Rescue me from the mire, <br/>   do not let me sink; <br/>  deliver me from those who hate me, <br/>   from the deep waters. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_15">  <sup>15</sup>Do not let the floodwaters engulf me <br/>   or the depths swallow me up <br/>   or the pit close its mouth over me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_16">  <sup>16</sup>Answer me, Lord, out of the goodness of your love; <br/>   in your great mercy turn to me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_17">  <sup>17</sup>Do not hide your face from your servant; <br/>   answer me quickly, for I am in trouble. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_18">  <sup>18</sup>Come near and rescue me; <br/>   deliver me because of my foes. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_19">  <sup>19</sup>You know how I am scorned, disgraced and shamed; <br/>   all my enemies are before you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_20">  <sup>20</sup>Scorn has broken my heart <br/>   and has left me helpless; <br/>  I looked for sympathy, but there was none, <br/>   for comforters, but I found none. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_21">  <sup>21</sup>They put gall in my food <br/>   and gave me vinegar for my thirst. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_22">  <sup>22</sup>May the table set before them become a snare; <br/>   may it become retribution and<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or snare / and their fellowship become">⚓</a> a trap. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_23">  <sup>23</sup>May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, <br/>   and their backs be bent forever. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_24">  <sup>24</sup>Pour out your wrath on them; <br/>   let your fierce anger overtake them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_25">  <sup>25</sup>May their place be deserted; <br/>   let there be no one to dwell in their tents. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_26">  <sup>26</sup>For they persecute those you wound <br/>   and talk about the pain of those you hurt. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_27">  <sup>27</sup>Charge them with crime upon crime; <br/>   do not let them share in your salvation. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_28">  <sup>28</sup>May they be blotted out of the book of life <br/>   and not be listed with the righteous. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_29">  <sup>29</sup>But as for me, afflicted and in pain— <br/>   may your salvation, God, protect me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_30">  <sup>30</sup>I will praise God’s name in song <br/>   and glorify him with thanksgiving. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_31">  <sup>31</sup>This will please the Lord more than an ox, <br/>   more than a bull with its horns and hooves. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_32">  <sup>32</sup>The poor will see and be glad— <br/>   you who seek God, may your hearts live! <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_33">  <sup>33</sup>The Lord hears the needy <br/>   and does not despise his captive people. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_34">  <sup>34</sup>Let heaven and earth praise him, <br/>   the seas and all that move in them, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_35">  <sup>35</sup>for God will save Zion <br/>   and rebuild the cities of Judah. <br/>  Then people will settle there and possess it; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_69_36">   <sup>36</sup>the children of his servants will inherit it, <br/>   and those who love his name will dwell there. <br/></span>
