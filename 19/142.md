<span class="verse thi_142_1">  <sup>1</sup>I cry aloud to the Lord; <br/>   I lift up my voice to the Lord for mercy. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_142_2">  <sup>2</sup>I pour out before him my complaint; <br/>   before him I tell my trouble. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_142_3">  <sup>3</sup>When my spirit grows faint within me, <br/>   it is you who watch over my way. <br/>  In the path where I walk <br/>   people have hidden a snare for me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_142_4">  <sup>4</sup>Look and see, there is no one at my right hand; <br/>   no one is concerned for me. <br/>  I have no refuge; <br/>   no one cares for my life. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_142_5">  <sup>5</sup>I cry to you, Lord; <br/>   I say, “You are my refuge, <br/>   my portion in the land of the living.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_142_6">  <sup>6</sup>Listen to my cry, <br/>   for I am in desperate need; <br/>  rescue me from those who pursue me, <br/>   for they are too strong for me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_142_7">  <sup>7</sup>Set me free from my prison, <br/>   that I may praise your name. <br/>  Then the righteous will gather about me <br/>   because of your goodness to me. <br/></span>
