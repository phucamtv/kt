<div class="title"><h1>35</h1><i>Of David.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_35_1">  <sup>1</sup>Contend, Lord, with those who contend with me; <br/>   fight against those who fight against me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_2">  <sup>2</sup>Take up shield and armor; <br/>   arise and come to my aid. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_3">  <sup>3</sup>Brandish spear and javelin<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or and block the way">⚓</a><br/>   against those who pursue me. <br/>  Say to me, <br/>   “I am your salvation.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_4">  <sup>4</sup>May those who seek my life <br/>   be disgraced and put to shame; <br/>  may those who plot my ruin <br/>   be turned back in dismay. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_5">  <sup>5</sup>May they be like chaff before the wind, <br/>   with the angel of the Lord driving them away; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_6">  <sup>6</sup>may their path be dark and slippery, <br/>   with the angel of the Lord pursuing them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_7">  <sup>7</sup>Since they hid their net for me without cause <br/>   and without cause dug a pit for me, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_8">  <sup>8</sup>may ruin overtake them by surprise— <br/>   may the net they hid entangle them, <br/>   may they fall into the pit, to their ruin. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_9">  <sup>9</sup>Then my soul will rejoice in the Lord<br/>   and delight in his salvation. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_10">  <sup>10</sup>My whole being will exclaim, <br/>   “Who is like you, Lord? <br/>  You rescue the poor from those too strong for them, <br/>   the poor and needy from those who rob them.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_11">  <sup>11</sup>Ruthless witnesses come forward; <br/>   they question me on things I know nothing about. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_12">  <sup>12</sup>They repay me evil for good <br/>   and leave me like one bereaved. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_13">  <sup>13</sup>Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth <br/>   and humbled myself with fasting. <br/>  When my prayers returned to me unanswered, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_14">   <sup>14</sup>I went about mourning <br/>   as though for my friend or brother. <br/>  I bowed my head in grief <br/>   as though weeping for my mother. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_15">  <sup>15</sup>But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee; <br/>   assailants gathered against me without my knowledge. <br/>   They slandered me without ceasing. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_16">  <sup>16</sup>Like the ungodly they maliciously mocked;<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint; Hebrew may mean Like an ungodly circle of mockers,">⚓</a><br/>   they gnashed their teeth at me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_17">  <sup>17</sup>How long, Lord, will you look on? <br/>   Rescue me from their ravages, <br/>   my precious life from these lions. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_18">  <sup>18</sup>I will give you thanks in the great assembly; <br/>   among the throngs I will praise you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_19">  <sup>19</sup>Do not let those gloat over me <br/>   who are my enemies without cause; <br/>  do not let those who hate me without reason <br/>   maliciously wink the eye. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_20">  <sup>20</sup>They do not speak peaceably, <br/>   but devise false accusations <br/>   against those who live quietly in the land. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_21">  <sup>21</sup>They sneer at me and say, “Aha! Aha! <br/>   With our own eyes we have seen it.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_22">  <sup>22</sup>Lord, you have seen this; do not be silent. <br/>   Do not be far from me, Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_23">  <sup>23</sup>Awake, and rise to my defense! <br/>   Contend for me, my God and Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_24">  <sup>24</sup>Vindicate me in your righteousness, Lord my God; <br/>   do not let them gloat over me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_25">  <sup>25</sup>Do not let them think, “Aha, just what we wanted!” <br/>   or say, “We have swallowed him up.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_26">  <sup>26</sup>May all who gloat over my distress <br/>   be put to shame and confusion; <br/>  may all who exalt themselves over me <br/>   be clothed with shame and disgrace. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_27">  <sup>27</sup>May those who delight in my vindication <br/>   shout for joy and gladness; <br/>  may they always say, “The Lord be exalted, <br/>   who delights in the well-being of his servant.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_35_28">  <sup>28</sup>My tongue will proclaim your righteousness, <br/>   your praises all day long. <br/></span>
