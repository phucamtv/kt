<span class="verse thi_44_1">  <sup>1</sup>We have heard it with our ears, O God; <br/>   our ancestors have told us <br/>  what you did in their days, <br/>   in days long ago. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_2">  <sup>2</sup>With your hand you drove out the nations <br/>   and planted our ancestors; <br/>  you crushed the peoples <br/>   and made our ancestors flourish. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_3">  <sup>3</sup>It was not by their sword that they won the land, <br/>   nor did their arm bring them victory; <br/>  it was your right hand, your arm, <br/>   and the light of your face, for you loved them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_4">  <sup>4</sup>You are my King and my God, <br/>   who decrees<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint, Aquila and Syriac; Hebrew King, O God; / command">⚓</a> victories for Jacob. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_5">  <sup>5</sup>Through you we push back our enemies; <br/>   through your name we trample our foes. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_6">  <sup>6</sup>I put no trust in my bow, <br/>   my sword does not bring me victory; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_7">  <sup>7</sup>but you give us victory over our enemies, <br/>   you put our adversaries to shame. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_8">  <sup>8</sup>In God we make our boast all day long, <br/>   and we will praise your name forever.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here.">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_9">  <sup>9</sup>But now you have rejected and humbled us; <br/>   you no longer go out with our armies. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_10">  <sup>10</sup>You made us retreat before the enemy, <br/>   and our adversaries have plundered us. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_11">  <sup>11</sup>You gave us up to be devoured like sheep <br/>   and have scattered us among the nations. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_12">  <sup>12</sup>You sold your people for a pittance, <br/>   gaining nothing from their sale. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_13">  <sup>13</sup>You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, <br/>   the scorn and derision of those around us. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_14">  <sup>14</sup>You have made us a byword among the nations; <br/>   the peoples shake their heads at us. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_15">  <sup>15</sup>I live in disgrace all day long, <br/>   and my face is covered with shame <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_16">  <sup>16</sup>at the taunts of those who reproach and revile me, <br/>   because of the enemy, who is bent on revenge. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_17">  <sup>17</sup>All this came upon us, <br/>   though we had not forgotten you; <br/>   we had not been false to your covenant. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_18">  <sup>18</sup>Our hearts had not turned back; <br/>   our feet had not strayed from your path. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_19">  <sup>19</sup>But you crushed us and made us a haunt for jackals; <br/>   you covered us over with deep darkness. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_20">  <sup>20</sup>If we had forgotten the name of our God <br/>   or spread out our hands to a foreign god, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_21">  <sup>21</sup>would not God have discovered it, <br/>   since he knows the secrets of the heart? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_22">  <sup>22</sup>Yet for your sake we face death all day long; <br/>   we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_23">  <sup>23</sup>Awake, Lord! Why do you sleep? <br/>   Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_24">  <sup>24</sup>Why do you hide your face <br/>   and forget our misery and oppression? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_25">  <sup>25</sup>We are brought down to the dust; <br/>   our bodies cling to the ground. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_44_26">  <sup>26</sup>Rise up and help us; <br/>   rescue us because of your unfailing love. <br/></span>
