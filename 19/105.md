<span class="verse thi_105_1">  <sup>1</sup>Give praise to the Lord, proclaim his name; <br/>   make known among the nations what he has done. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_2">  <sup>2</sup>Sing to him, sing praise to him; <br/>   tell of all his wonderful acts. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_3">  <sup>3</sup>Glory in his holy name; <br/>   let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_4">  <sup>4</sup>Look to the Lord and his strength; <br/>   seek his face always. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_5">  <sup>5</sup>Remember the wonders he has done, <br/>   his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_6">  <sup>6</sup>you his servants, the descendants of Abraham, <br/>   his chosen ones, the children of Jacob. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_7">  <sup>7</sup>He is the Lord our God; <br/>   his judgments are in all the earth. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_8">  <sup>8</sup>He remembers his covenant forever, <br/>   the promise he made, for a thousand generations, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_9">  <sup>9</sup>the covenant he made with Abraham, <br/>   the oath he swore to Isaac. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_10">  <sup>10</sup>He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, <br/>   to Israel as an everlasting covenant: <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_11">  <sup>11</sup>“To you I will give the land of Canaan <br/>   as the portion you will inherit.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_12">  <sup>12</sup>When they were but few in number, <br/>   few indeed, and strangers in it, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_13">  <sup>13</sup>they wandered from nation to nation, <br/>   from one kingdom to another. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_14">  <sup>14</sup>He allowed no one to oppress them; <br/>   for their sake he rebuked kings: <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_15">  <sup>15</sup>“Do not touch my anointed ones; <br/>   do my prophets no harm.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_16">  <sup>16</sup>He called down famine on the land <br/>   and destroyed all their supplies of food; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_17">  <sup>17</sup>and he sent a man before them— <br/>   Joseph, sold as a slave. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_18">  <sup>18</sup>They bruised his feet with shackles, <br/>   his neck was put in irons, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_19">  <sup>19</sup>till what he foretold came to pass, <br/>   till the word of the Lord proved him true. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_20">  <sup>20</sup>The king sent and released him, <br/>   the ruler of peoples set him free. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_21">  <sup>21</sup>He made him master of his household, <br/>   ruler over all he possessed, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_22">  <sup>22</sup>to instruct his princes as he pleased <br/>   and teach his elders wisdom. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_23">  <sup>23</sup>Then Israel entered Egypt; <br/>   Jacob resided as a foreigner in the land of Ham. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_24">  <sup>24</sup>The Lord made his people very fruitful; <br/>   he made them too numerous for their foes, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_25">  <sup>25</sup>whose hearts he turned to hate his people, <br/>   to conspire against his servants. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_26">  <sup>26</sup>He sent Moses his servant, <br/>   and Aaron, whom he had chosen. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_27">  <sup>27</sup>They performed his signs among them, <br/>   his wonders in the land of Ham. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_28">  <sup>28</sup>He sent darkness and made the land dark— <br/>   for had they not rebelled against his words? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_29">  <sup>29</sup>He turned their waters into blood, <br/>   causing their fish to die. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_30">  <sup>30</sup>Their land teemed with frogs, <br/>   which went up into the bedrooms of their rulers. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_31">  <sup>31</sup>He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, <br/>   and gnats throughout their country. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_32">  <sup>32</sup>He turned their rain into hail, <br/>   with lightning throughout their land; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_33">  <sup>33</sup>he struck down their vines and fig trees <br/>   and shattered the trees of their country. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_34">  <sup>34</sup>He spoke, and the locusts came, <br/>   grasshoppers without number; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_35">  <sup>35</sup>they ate up every green thing in their land, <br/>   ate up the produce of their soil. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_36">  <sup>36</sup>Then he struck down all the firstborn in their land, <br/>   the firstfruits of all their manhood. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_37">  <sup>37</sup>He brought out Israel, laden with silver and gold, <br/>   and from among their tribes no one faltered. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_38">  <sup>38</sup>Egypt was glad when they left, <br/>   because dread of Israel had fallen on them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_39">  <sup>39</sup>He spread out a cloud as a covering, <br/>   and a fire to give light at night. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_40">  <sup>40</sup>They asked, and he brought them quail; <br/>   he fed them well with the bread of heaven. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_41">  <sup>41</sup>He opened the rock, and water gushed out; <br/>   it flowed like a river in the desert. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_42">  <sup>42</sup>For he remembered his holy promise <br/>   given to his servant Abraham. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_43">  <sup>43</sup>He brought out his people with rejoicing, <br/>   his chosen ones with shouts of joy; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_44">  <sup>44</sup>he gave them the lands of the nations, <br/>   and they fell heir to what others had toiled for— <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_105_45">  <sup>45</sup>that they might keep his precepts <br/>   and observe his laws. <br/><br/>  Praise the Lord.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew Hallelu Yah">⚓</a><br/></span>
