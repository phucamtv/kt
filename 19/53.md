<span class="verse thi_53_1">  <sup>1</sup>The fool says in his heart, <br/>   “There is no God.” <br/>  They are corrupt, and their ways are vile; <br/>   there is no one who does good. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_53_2">  <sup>2</sup>God looks down from heaven <br/>   on all mankind <br/>  to see if there are any who understand, <br/>   any who seek God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_53_3">  <sup>3</sup>Everyone has turned away, all have become corrupt; <br/>   there is no one who does good, <br/>   not even one. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_53_4">  <sup>4</sup>Do all these evildoers know nothing? <br/><br/>  They devour my people as though eating bread; <br/>   they never call on God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_53_5">  <sup>5</sup>But there they are, overwhelmed with dread, <br/>   where there was nothing to dread. <br/>  God scattered the bones of those who attacked you; <br/>   you put them to shame, for God despised them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_53_6">  <sup>6</sup>Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! <br/>   When God restores his people, <br/>   let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad! <br/></span>
