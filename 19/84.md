<span class="verse thi_84_2">  <sup>2</sup>My soul yearns, even faints, <br/>   for the courts of the Lord; <br/>  my heart and my flesh cry out <br/>   for the living God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_84_3">  <sup>3</sup>Even the sparrow has found a home, <br/>   and the swallow a nest for herself, <br/>   where she may have her young— <br/>  a place near your altar, <br/>   Lord Almighty, my King and my God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_84_4">  <sup>4</sup>Blessed are those who dwell in your house; <br/>   they are ever praising you.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here and at the end of verse 8.">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>

<span class="verse thi_84_6">  <sup>6</sup>As they pass through the Valley of Baka, <br/>   they make it a place of springs; <br/>   the autumn rains also cover it with pools.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or blessings">⚓</a><br/></span>

<span class="verse thi_84_10">  <sup>10</sup>Better is one day in your courts <br/>   than a thousand elsewhere; <br/>  I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God <br/>   than dwell in the tents of the wicked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_84_11">  <sup>11</sup>For the Lord God is a sun and shield; <br/>   the Lord bestows favor and honor; <br/>  no good thing does he withhold <br/>   from those whose walk is blameless. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_84_12">  <sup>12</sup>Lord Almighty, <br/>   blessed is the one who trusts in you. <br/></span>
