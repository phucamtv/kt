<div class="title"><h1>58</h1><i>For the director of music. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” Of David. A miktam.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Title: Probably a literary or musical term">⚓</a></i></div>
<span class="verse thi_58_1">  <sup>1</sup>Do you rulers indeed speak justly? <br/>   Do you judge people with equity? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_58_2">  <sup>2</sup>No, in your heart you devise injustice, <br/>   and your hands mete out violence on the earth. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_58_3">  <sup>3</sup>Even from birth the wicked go astray; <br/>   from the womb they are wayward, spreading lies. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_58_4">  <sup>4</sup>Their venom is like the venom of a snake, <br/>   like that of a cobra that has stopped its ears, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_58_5">  <sup>5</sup>that will not heed the tune of the charmer, <br/>   however skillful the enchanter may be. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_58_6">  <sup>6</sup>Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; <br/>   Lord, tear out the fangs of those lions! <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_58_7">  <sup>7</sup>Let them vanish like water that flows away; <br/>   when they draw the bow, let their arrows fall short. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_58_8">  <sup>8</sup>May they be like a slug that melts away as it moves along, <br/>   like a stillborn child that never sees the sun. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_58_9">  <sup>9</sup>Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns— <br/>   whether they be green or dry—the wicked will be swept away.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this verse is uncertain.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_58_10">  <sup>10</sup>The righteous will be glad when they are avenged, <br/>   when they dip their feet in the blood of the wicked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_58_11">  <sup>11</sup>Then people will say, <br/>   “Surely the righteous still are rewarded; <br/>   surely there is a God who judges the earth.” <br/></span>
