<div class="title"><h1>43</h1></div>
<span class="verse thi_43_1">  <sup>1</sup>Vindicate me, my God, <br/>   and plead my cause <br/>   against an unfaithful nation. <br/>  Rescue me from those who are <br/>   deceitful and wicked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_43_2">  <sup>2</sup>You are God my stronghold. <br/>   Why have you rejected me? <br/>  Why must I go about mourning, <br/>   oppressed by the enemy? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_43_3">  <sup>3</sup>Send me your light and your faithful care, <br/>   let them lead me; <br/>  let them bring me to your holy mountain, <br/>   to the place where you dwell. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_43_4">  <sup>4</sup>Then I will go to the altar of God, <br/>   to God, my joy and my delight. <br/>  I will praise you with the lyre, <br/>   O God, my God. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_43_5">  <sup>5</sup>Why, my soul, are you downcast? <br/>   Why so disturbed within me? <br/>  Put your hope in God, <br/>   for I will yet praise him, <br/>   my Savior and my God. <br/></span>
