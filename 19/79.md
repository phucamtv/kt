<div class="title"><h1>79</h1><i>A psalm of Asaph.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_79_1">  <sup>1</sup>O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance; <br/>   they have defiled your holy temple, <br/>   they have reduced Jerusalem to rubble. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_79_2">  <sup>2</sup>They have left the dead bodies of your servants <br/>   as food for the birds of the sky, <br/>   the flesh of your own people for the animals of the wild. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_79_3">  <sup>3</sup>They have poured out blood like water <br/>   all around Jerusalem, <br/>   and there is no one to bury the dead. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_79_4">  <sup>4</sup>We are objects of contempt to our neighbors, <br/>   of scorn and derision to those around us. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_79_5">  <sup>5</sup>How long, Lord? Will you be angry forever? <br/>   How long will your jealousy burn like fire? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_79_6">  <sup>6</sup>Pour out your wrath on the nations <br/>   that do not acknowledge you, <br/>  on the kingdoms <br/>   that do not call on your name; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_79_7">  <sup>7</sup>for they have devoured Jacob <br/>   and devastated his homeland. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_79_8">  <sup>8</sup>Do not hold against us the sins of past generations; <br/>   may your mercy come quickly to meet us, <br/>   for we are in desperate need. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_79_9">  <sup>9</sup>Help us, God our Savior, <br/>   for the glory of your name; <br/>  deliver us and forgive our sins <br/>   for your name’s sake. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_79_10">  <sup>10</sup>Why should the nations say, <br/>   “Where is their God?” <br/><br/>  Before our eyes, make known among the nations <br/>   that you avenge the outpoured blood of your servants. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_79_11">  <sup>11</sup>May the groans of the prisoners come before you; <br/>   with your strong arm preserve those condemned to die. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_79_12">  <sup>12</sup>Pay back into the laps of our neighbors seven times <br/>   the contempt they have hurled at you, Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_79_13">  <sup>13</sup>Then we your people, the sheep of your pasture, <br/>   will praise you forever; <br/>  from generation to generation <br/>   we will proclaim your praise. <br/></span>
