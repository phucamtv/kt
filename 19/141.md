<div class="title"><h1>141</h1><i>A psalm of David.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_141_1">  <sup>1</sup>I call to you, Lord, come quickly to me; <br/>   hear me when I call to you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_141_2">  <sup>2</sup>May my prayer be set before you like incense; <br/>   may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_141_3">  <sup>3</sup>Set a guard over my mouth, Lord; <br/>   keep watch over the door of my lips. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_141_4">  <sup>4</sup>Do not let my heart be drawn to what is evil <br/>   so that I take part in wicked deeds <br/>  along with those who are evildoers; <br/>   do not let me eat their delicacies. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_141_5">  <sup>5</sup>Let a righteous man strike me—that is a kindness; <br/>   let him rebuke me—that is oil on my head. <br/>  My head will not refuse it, <br/>   for my prayer will still be against the deeds of evildoers. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_141_6">  <sup>6</sup>Their rulers will be thrown down from the cliffs, <br/>   and the wicked will learn that my words were well spoken. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_141_7">  <sup>7</sup>They will say, “As one plows and breaks up the earth, <br/>   so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the grave.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_141_8">  <sup>8</sup>But my eyes are fixed on you, Sovereign Lord; <br/>   in you I take refuge—do not give me over to death. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_141_9">  <sup>9</sup>Keep me safe from the traps set by evildoers, <br/>   from the snares they have laid for me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_141_10">  <sup>10</sup>Let the wicked fall into their own nets, <br/>   while I pass by in safety. <br/></span>
