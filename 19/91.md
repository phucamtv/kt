<span class="verse thi_91_2">  <sup>2</sup>I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress, <br/>   my God, in whom I trust.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_91_3">  <sup>3</sup>Surely he will save you <br/>   from the fowler’s snare <br/>   and from the deadly pestilence. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_91_4">  <sup>4</sup>He will cover you with his feathers, <br/>   and under his wings you will find refuge; <br/>   his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_91_5">  <sup>5</sup>You will not fear the terror of night, <br/>   nor the arrow that flies by day, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_91_6">  <sup>6</sup>nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, <br/>   nor the plague that destroys at midday. <br/></span>

<span class="verse thi_91_11">  <sup>11</sup>For he will command his angels concerning you <br/>   to guard you in all your ways; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_91_12">  <sup>12</sup>they will lift you up in their hands, <br/>   so that you will not strike your foot against a stone. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_91_13">  <sup>13</sup>You will tread on the lion and the cobra; <br/>   you will trample the great lion and the serpent. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_91_14">  <sup>14</sup>“Because he<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, probably the king">⚓</a> loves me,” says the Lord, “I will rescue him; <br/>   I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_91_15">  <sup>15</sup>He will call on me, and I will answer him; <br/>   I will be with him in trouble, <br/>   I will deliver him and honor him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_91_16">  <sup>16</sup>With long life I will satisfy him <br/>   and show him my salvation.” <br/></span>
