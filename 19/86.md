<span class="verse thi_86_1">  <sup>1</sup>Hear me, Lord, and answer me, <br/>   for I am poor and needy. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_86_2">  <sup>2</sup>Guard my life, for I am faithful to you; <br/>   save your servant who trusts in you. <br/>  You are my God; </span>
<span class="verse thi_86_3">  <sup>3</sup>have mercy on me, Lord, <br/>   for I call to you all day long. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_86_4">  <sup>4</sup>Bring joy to your servant, Lord, <br/>   for I put my trust in you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_86_5">  <sup>5</sup>You, Lord, are forgiving and good, <br/>   abounding in love to all who call to you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_86_6">  <sup>6</sup>Hear my prayer, Lord; <br/>   listen to my cry for mercy. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_86_7">  <sup>7</sup>When I am in distress, I call to you, <br/>   because you answer me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_86_8">  <sup>8</sup>Among the gods there is none like you, Lord; <br/>   no deeds can compare with yours. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_86_9">  <sup>9</sup>All the nations you have made <br/>   will come and worship before you, Lord; <br/>   they will bring glory to your name. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_86_10">  <sup>10</sup>For you are great and do marvelous deeds; <br/>   you alone are God. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_86_11">  <sup>11</sup>Teach me your way, Lord, <br/>   that I may rely on your faithfulness; <br/>  give me an undivided heart, <br/>   that I may fear your name. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_86_12">  <sup>12</sup>I will praise you, Lord my God, with all my heart; <br/>   I will glorify your name forever. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_86_13">  <sup>13</sup>For great is your love toward me; <br/>   you have delivered me from the depths, <br/>   from the realm of the dead. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_86_14">  <sup>14</sup>Arrogant foes are attacking me, O God; <br/>   ruthless people are trying to kill me— <br/>   they have no regard for you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_86_15">  <sup>15</sup>But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, <br/>   slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_86_16">  <sup>16</sup>Turn to me and have mercy on me; <br/>   show your strength in behalf of your servant; <br/>  save me, because I serve you <br/>   just as my mother did. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_86_17">  <sup>17</sup>Give me a sign of your goodness, <br/>   that my enemies may see it and be put to shame, <br/>   for you, Lord, have helped me and comforted me. <br/></span>
