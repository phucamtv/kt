<span class="verse thi_71_1">  <sup>1</sup>In you, Lord, I have taken refuge; <br/>   let me never be put to shame. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_2">  <sup>2</sup>In your righteousness, rescue me and deliver me; <br/>   turn your ear to me and save me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_3">  <sup>3</sup>Be my rock of refuge, <br/>   to which I can always go; <br/>  give the command to save me, <br/>   for you are my rock and my fortress. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_4">  <sup>4</sup>Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, <br/>   from the grasp of those who are evil and cruel. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_5">  <sup>5</sup>For you have been my hope, Sovereign Lord, <br/>   my confidence since my youth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_6">  <sup>6</sup>From birth I have relied on you; <br/>   you brought me forth from my mother’s womb. <br/>   I will ever praise you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_7">  <sup>7</sup>I have become a sign to many; <br/>   you are my strong refuge. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_8">  <sup>8</sup>My mouth is filled with your praise, <br/>   declaring your splendor all day long. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_9">  <sup>9</sup>Do not cast me away when I am old; <br/>   do not forsake me when my strength is gone. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_10">  <sup>10</sup>For my enemies speak against me; <br/>   those who wait to kill me conspire together. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_11">  <sup>11</sup>They say, “God has forsaken him; <br/>   pursue him and seize him, <br/>   for no one will rescue him.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_12">  <sup>12</sup>Do not be far from me, my God; <br/>   come quickly, God, to help me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_13">  <sup>13</sup>May my accusers perish in shame; <br/>   may those who want to harm me <br/>   be covered with scorn and disgrace. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_14">  <sup>14</sup>As for me, I will always have hope; <br/>   I will praise you more and more. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_15">  <sup>15</sup>My mouth will tell of your righteous deeds, <br/>   of your saving acts all day long— <br/>   though I know not how to relate them all. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_16">  <sup>16</sup>I will come and proclaim your mighty acts, Sovereign Lord; <br/>   I will proclaim your righteous deeds, yours alone. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_17">  <sup>17</sup>Since my youth, God, you have taught me, <br/>   and to this day I declare your marvelous deeds. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_18">  <sup>18</sup>Even when I am old and gray, <br/>   do not forsake me, my God, <br/>  till I declare your power to the next generation, <br/>   your mighty acts to all who are to come. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_19">  <sup>19</sup>Your righteousness, God, reaches to the heavens, <br/>   you who have done great things. <br/>   Who is like you, God? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_20">  <sup>20</sup>Though you have made me see troubles, <br/>   many and bitter, <br/>   you will restore my life again; <br/>  from the depths of the earth <br/>   you will again bring me up. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_21">  <sup>21</sup>You will increase my honor <br/>   and comfort me once more. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_22">  <sup>22</sup>I will praise you with the harp <br/>   for your faithfulness, my God; <br/>  I will sing praise to you with the lyre, <br/>   Holy One of Israel. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_23">  <sup>23</sup>My lips will shout for joy <br/>   when I sing praise to you— <br/>   I whom you have delivered. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_71_24">  <sup>24</sup>My tongue will tell of your righteous acts <br/>   all day long, <br/>  for those who wanted to harm me <br/>   have been put to shame and confusion. <br/></span>
