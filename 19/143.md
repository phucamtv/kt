<div class="title"><h1>143</h1><i>A psalm of David.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_143_1">  <sup>1</sup>Lord, hear my prayer, <br/>   listen to my cry for mercy; <br/>  in your faithfulness and righteousness <br/>   come to my relief. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_143_2">  <sup>2</sup>Do not bring your servant into judgment, <br/>   for no one living is righteous before you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_143_3">  <sup>3</sup>The enemy pursues me, <br/>   he crushes me to the ground; <br/>  he makes me dwell in the darkness <br/>   like those long dead. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_143_4">  <sup>4</sup>So my spirit grows faint within me; <br/>   my heart within me is dismayed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_143_5">  <sup>5</sup>I remember the days of long ago; <br/>   I meditate on all your works <br/>   and consider what your hands have done. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_143_6">  <sup>6</sup>I spread out my hands to you; <br/>   I thirst for you like a parched land.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here.">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_143_7">  <sup>7</sup>Answer me quickly, Lord; <br/>   my spirit fails. <br/>  Do not hide your face from me <br/>   or I will be like those who go down to the pit. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_143_8">  <sup>8</sup>Let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love, <br/>   for I have put my trust in you. <br/>  Show me the way I should go, <br/>   for to you I entrust my life. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_143_9">  <sup>9</sup>Rescue me from my enemies, Lord, <br/>   for I hide myself in you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_143_10">  <sup>10</sup>Teach me to do your will, <br/>   for you are my God; <br/>  may your good Spirit <br/>   lead me on level ground. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_143_11">  <sup>11</sup>For your name’s sake, Lord, preserve my life; <br/>   in your righteousness, bring me out of trouble. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_143_12">  <sup>12</sup>In your unfailing love, silence my enemies; <br/>   destroy all my foes, <br/>   for I am your servant. <br/></span>
