<span class="verse thi_138_1">  <sup>1</sup>I will praise you, Lord, with all my heart; <br/>   before the “gods” I will sing your praise. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_138_2">  <sup>2</sup>I will bow down toward your holy temple <br/>   and will praise your name <br/>   for your unfailing love and your faithfulness, <br/>  for you have so exalted your solemn decree <br/>   that it surpasses your fame. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_138_3">  <sup>3</sup>When I called, you answered me; <br/>   you greatly emboldened me. <br/><br/></span>

<span class="verse thi_138_7">  <sup>7</sup>Though I walk in the midst of trouble, <br/>   you preserve my life. <br/>  You stretch out your hand against the anger of my foes; <br/>   with your right hand you save me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_138_8">  <sup>8</sup>The Lord will vindicate me; <br/>   your love, Lord, endures forever— <br/>   do not abandon the works of your hands. <br/></span>
