<span class="verse thi_78_1">  <sup>1</sup>My people, hear my teaching; <br/>   listen to the words of my mouth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_2">  <sup>2</sup>I will open my mouth with a parable; <br/>   I will utter hidden things, things from of old— <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_3">  <sup>3</sup>things we have heard and known, <br/>   things our ancestors have told us. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_4">  <sup>4</sup>We will not hide them from their descendants; <br/>   we will tell the next generation <br/>  the praiseworthy deeds of the Lord, <br/>   his power, and the wonders he has done. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_5">  <sup>5</sup>He decreed statutes for Jacob <br/>   and established the law in Israel, <br/>  which he commanded our ancestors <br/>   to teach their children, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_6">  <sup>6</sup>so the next generation would know them, <br/>   even the children yet to be born, <br/>   and they in turn would tell their children. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_7">  <sup>7</sup>Then they would put their trust in God <br/>   and would not forget his deeds <br/>   but would keep his commands. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_8">  <sup>8</sup>They would not be like their ancestors— <br/>   a stubborn and rebellious generation, <br/>  whose hearts were not loyal to God, <br/>   whose spirits were not faithful to him. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_9">  <sup>9</sup>The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows, <br/>   turned back on the day of battle; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_10">  <sup>10</sup>they did not keep God’s covenant <br/>   and refused to live by his law. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_11">  <sup>11</sup>They forgot what he had done, <br/>   the wonders he had shown them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_12">  <sup>12</sup>He did miracles in the sight of their ancestors <br/>   in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_13">  <sup>13</sup>He divided the sea and led them through; <br/>   he made the water stand up like a wall. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_14">  <sup>14</sup>He guided them with the cloud by day <br/>   and with light from the fire all night. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_15">  <sup>15</sup>He split the rocks in the wilderness <br/>   and gave them water as abundant as the seas; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_16">  <sup>16</sup>he brought streams out of a rocky crag <br/>   and made water flow down like rivers. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_17">  <sup>17</sup>But they continued to sin against him, <br/>   rebelling in the wilderness against the Most High. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_18">  <sup>18</sup>They willfully put God to the test <br/>   by demanding the food they craved. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_19">  <sup>19</sup>They spoke against God; <br/>   they said, “Can God really <br/>   spread a table in the wilderness? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_20">  <sup>20</sup>True, he struck the rock, <br/>   and water gushed out, <br/>   streams flowed abundantly, <br/>  but can he also give us bread? <br/>   Can he supply meat for his people?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_21">  <sup>21</sup>When the Lord heard them, he was furious; <br/>   his fire broke out against Jacob, <br/>   and his wrath rose against Israel, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_22">  <sup>22</sup>for they did not believe in God <br/>   or trust in his deliverance. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_23">  <sup>23</sup>Yet he gave a command to the skies above <br/>   and opened the doors of the heavens; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_24">  <sup>24</sup>he rained down manna for the people to eat, <br/>   he gave them the grain of heaven. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_25">  <sup>25</sup>Human beings ate the bread of angels; <br/>   he sent them all the food they could eat. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_26">  <sup>26</sup>He let loose the east wind from the heavens <br/>   and by his power made the south wind blow. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_27">  <sup>27</sup>He rained meat down on them like dust, <br/>   birds like sand on the seashore. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_28">  <sup>28</sup>He made them come down inside their camp, <br/>   all around their tents. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_29">  <sup>29</sup>They ate till they were gorged— <br/>   he had given them what they craved. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_30">  <sup>30</sup>But before they turned from what they craved, <br/>   even while the food was still in their mouths, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_31">  <sup>31</sup>God’s anger rose against them; <br/>   he put to death the sturdiest among them, <br/>   cutting down the young men of Israel. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_32">  <sup>32</sup>In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; <br/>   in spite of his wonders, they did not believe. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_33">  <sup>33</sup>So he ended their days in futility <br/>   and their years in terror. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_34">  <sup>34</sup>Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; <br/>   they eagerly turned to him again. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_35">  <sup>35</sup>They remembered that God was their Rock, <br/>   that God Most High was their Redeemer. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_36">  <sup>36</sup>But then they would flatter him with their mouths, <br/>   lying to him with their tongues; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_37">  <sup>37</sup>their hearts were not loyal to him, <br/>   they were not faithful to his covenant. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_38">  <sup>38</sup>Yet he was merciful; <br/>   he forgave their iniquities <br/>   and did not destroy them. <br/>  Time after time he restrained his anger <br/>   and did not stir up his full wrath. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_39">  <sup>39</sup>He remembered that they were but flesh, <br/>   a passing breeze that does not return. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_40">  <sup>40</sup>How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness <br/>   and grieved him in the wasteland! <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_41">  <sup>41</sup>Again and again they put God to the test; <br/>   they vexed the Holy One of Israel. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_42">  <sup>42</sup>They did not remember his power— <br/>   the day he redeemed them from the oppressor, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_43">  <sup>43</sup>the day he displayed his signs in Egypt, <br/>   his wonders in the region of Zoan. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_44">  <sup>44</sup>He turned their river into blood; <br/>   they could not drink from their streams. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_45">  <sup>45</sup>He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, <br/>   and frogs that devastated them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_46">  <sup>46</sup>He gave their crops to the grasshopper, <br/>   their produce to the locust. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_47">  <sup>47</sup>He destroyed their vines with hail <br/>   and their sycamore-figs with sleet. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_48">  <sup>48</sup>He gave over their cattle to the hail, <br/>   their livestock to bolts of lightning. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_49">  <sup>49</sup>He unleashed against them his hot anger, <br/>   his wrath, indignation and hostility— <br/>   a band of destroying angels. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_50">  <sup>50</sup>He prepared a path for his anger; <br/>   he did not spare them from death <br/>   but gave them over to the plague. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_51">  <sup>51</sup>He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, <br/>   the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_52">  <sup>52</sup>But he brought his people out like a flock; <br/>   he led them like sheep through the wilderness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_53">  <sup>53</sup>He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; <br/>   but the sea engulfed their enemies. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_54">  <sup>54</sup>And so he brought them to the border of his holy land, <br/>   to the hill country his right hand had taken. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_55">  <sup>55</sup>He drove out nations before them <br/>   and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; <br/>   he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_56">  <sup>56</sup>But they put God to the test <br/>   and rebelled against the Most High; <br/>   they did not keep his statutes. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_57">  <sup>57</sup>Like their ancestors they were disloyal and faithless, <br/>   as unreliable as a faulty bow. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_58">  <sup>58</sup>They angered him with their high places; <br/>   they aroused his jealousy with their idols. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_59">  <sup>59</sup>When God heard them, he was furious; <br/>   he rejected Israel completely. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_60">  <sup>60</sup>He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, <br/>   the tent he had set up among humans. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_61">  <sup>61</sup>He sent the ark of his might into captivity, <br/>   his splendor into the hands of the enemy. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_62">  <sup>62</sup>He gave his people over to the sword; <br/>   he was furious with his inheritance. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_63">  <sup>63</sup>Fire consumed their young men, <br/>   and their young women had no wedding songs; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_64">  <sup>64</sup>their priests were put to the sword, <br/>   and their widows could not weep. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_65">  <sup>65</sup>Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, <br/>   as a warrior wakes from the stupor of wine. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_66">  <sup>66</sup>He beat back his enemies; <br/>   he put them to everlasting shame. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_67">  <sup>67</sup>Then he rejected the tents of Joseph, <br/>   he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_68">  <sup>68</sup>but he chose the tribe of Judah, <br/>   Mount Zion, which he loved. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_69">  <sup>69</sup>He built his sanctuary like the heights, <br/>   like the earth that he established forever. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_70">  <sup>70</sup>He chose David his servant <br/>   and took him from the sheep pens; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_71">  <sup>71</sup>from tending the sheep he brought him <br/>   to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, <br/>   of Israel his inheritance. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_78_72">  <sup>72</sup>And David shepherded them with integrity of heart; <br/>   with skillful hands he led them. <br/></span>
