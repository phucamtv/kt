<span class="verse thi_89_40">  <sup>40</sup>You have broken through all his walls <br/>   and reduced his strongholds to ruins. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_89_41">  <sup>41</sup>All who pass by have plundered him; <br/>   he has become the scorn of his neighbors. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_89_42">  <sup>42</sup>You have exalted the right hand of his foes; <br/>   you have made all his enemies rejoice. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_89_43">  <sup>43</sup>Indeed, you have turned back the edge of his sword <br/>   and have not supported him in battle. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_89_44">  <sup>44</sup>You have put an end to his splendor <br/>   and cast his throne to the ground. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_89_45">  <sup>45</sup>You have cut short the days of his youth; <br/>   you have covered him with a mantle of shame. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_89_46">  <sup>46</sup>How long, Lord? Will you hide yourself forever? <br/>   How long will your wrath burn like fire? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_89_47">  <sup>47</sup>Remember how fleeting is my life. <br/>   For what futility you have created all humanity! <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_89_48">  <sup>48</sup>Who can live and not see death, <br/>   or who can escape the power of the grave? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_89_49">  <sup>49</sup>Lord, where is your former great love, <br/>   which in your faithfulness you swore to David? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_89_50">  <sup>50</sup>Remember, Lord, how your servant has<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or your servants have">⚓</a> been mocked, <br/>   how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the nations, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_89_51">  <sup>51</sup>the taunts with which your enemies, Lord, have mocked, <br/>   with which they have mocked every step of your anointed one. <br/><br/></span>
