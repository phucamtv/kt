<span class="verse thi_108_1">  <sup>1</sup>My heart, O God, is steadfast; <br/>   I will sing and make music with all my soul. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_108_2">  <sup>2</sup>Awake, harp and lyre! <br/>   I will awaken the dawn. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_108_3">  <sup>3</sup>I will praise you, Lord, among the nations; <br/>   I will sing of you among the peoples. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_108_4">  <sup>4</sup>For great is your love, higher than the heavens; <br/>   your faithfulness reaches to the skies. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_108_5">  <sup>5</sup>Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; <br/>   let your glory be over all the earth. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_108_6">  <sup>6</sup>Save us and help us with your right hand, <br/>   that those you love may be delivered. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_108_7">  <sup>7</sup>God has spoken from his sanctuary: <br/>   “In triumph I will parcel out Shechem <br/>   and measure off the Valley of Sukkoth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_108_8">  <sup>8</sup>Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine; <br/>   Ephraim is my helmet, <br/>   Judah is my scepter. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_108_9">  <sup>9</sup>Moab is my washbasin, <br/>   on Edom I toss my sandal; <br/>   over Philistia I shout in triumph.” <br/><br/></span>
