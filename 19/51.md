<div class="title"><h1>51</h1><i>For the director of music. A psalm of David. When the prophet Nathan came to him after David had committed adultery with Bathsheba.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_51_1">  <sup>1</sup>Have mercy on me, O God, <br/>   according to your unfailing love; <br/>  according to your great compassion <br/>   blot out my transgressions. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_51_2">  <sup>2</sup>Wash away all my iniquity <br/>   and cleanse me from my sin. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_51_3">  <sup>3</sup>For I know my transgressions, <br/>   and my sin is always before me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_51_4">  <sup>4</sup>Against you, you only, have I sinned <br/>   and done what is evil in your sight; <br/>  so you are right in your verdict <br/>   and justified when you judge. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_51_5">  <sup>5</sup>Surely I was sinful at birth, <br/>   sinful from the time my mother conceived me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_51_6">  <sup>6</sup>Yet you desired faithfulness even in the womb; <br/>   you taught me wisdom in that secret place. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_51_7">  <sup>7</sup>Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean; <br/>   wash me, and I will be whiter than snow. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_51_8">  <sup>8</sup>Let me hear joy and gladness; <br/>   let the bones you have crushed rejoice. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_51_9">  <sup>9</sup>Hide your face from my sins <br/>   and blot out all my iniquity. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_51_10">  <sup>10</sup>Create in me a pure heart, O God, <br/>   and renew a steadfast spirit within me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_51_11">  <sup>11</sup>Do not cast me from your presence <br/>   or take your Holy Spirit from me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_51_12">  <sup>12</sup>Restore to me the joy of your salvation <br/>   and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_51_13">  <sup>13</sup>Then I will teach transgressors your ways, <br/>   so that sinners will turn back to you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_51_14">  <sup>14</sup>Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, <br/>   you who are God my Savior, <br/>   and my tongue will sing of your righteousness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_51_15">  <sup>15</sup>Open my lips, Lord, <br/>   and my mouth will declare your praise. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_51_16">  <sup>16</sup>You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; <br/>   you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_51_17">  <sup>17</sup>My sacrifice, O God, is<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or The sacrifices of God are">⚓</a> a broken spirit; <br/>   a broken and contrite heart <br/>   you, God, will not despise. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_51_18">  <sup>18</sup>May it please you to prosper Zion, <br/>   to build up the walls of Jerusalem. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_51_19">  <sup>19</sup>Then you will delight in the sacrifices of the righteous, <br/>   in burnt offerings offered whole; <br/>   then bulls will be offered on your altar. <br/></span>
