<div class="title"><h1>60</h1><i>For the director of music. To the tune of “The Lily of the Covenant.” A miktam<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Title: Probably a literary or musical term">⚓</a> of David. For teaching. When he fought Aram Naharaim<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Title: That is, Arameans of Northwest Mesopotamia">⚓</a> and Aram Zobah,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Title: That is, Arameans of central Syria">⚓</a> and when Joab returned and struck down twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_60_1">  <sup>1</sup>You have rejected us, God, and burst upon us; <br/>   you have been angry—now restore us! <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_60_2">  <sup>2</sup>You have shaken the land and torn it open; <br/>   mend its fractures, for it is quaking. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_60_3">  <sup>3</sup>You have shown your people desperate times; <br/>   you have given us wine that makes us stagger. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_60_4">  <sup>4</sup>But for those who fear you, you have raised a banner <br/>   to be unfurled against the bow.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here.">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_60_5">  <sup>5</sup>Save us and help us with your right hand, <br/>   that those you love may be delivered. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_60_6">  <sup>6</sup>God has spoken from his sanctuary: <br/>   “In triumph I will parcel out Shechem <br/>   and measure off the Valley of Sukkoth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_60_7">  <sup>7</sup>Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; <br/>   Ephraim is my helmet, <br/>   Judah is my scepter. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_60_8">  <sup>8</sup>Moab is my washbasin, <br/>   on Edom I toss my sandal; <br/>   over Philistia I shout in triumph.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_60_9">  <sup>9</sup>Who will bring me to the fortified city? <br/>   Who will lead me to Edom? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_60_10">  <sup>10</sup>Is it not you, God, you who have now rejected us <br/>   and no longer go out with our armies? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_60_11">  <sup>11</sup>Give us aid against the enemy, <br/>   for human help is worthless. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_60_12">  <sup>12</sup>With God we will gain the victory, <br/>   and he will trample down our enemies. <br/></span>
