<span class="verse thi_106_1">  <sup>1</sup>Praise the Lord.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew Hallelu Yah ; also in verse 48">⚓</a><br/><br/>  Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; <br/>   his love endures forever. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_2">  <sup>2</sup>Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the Lord<br/>   or fully declare his praise? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_3">  <sup>3</sup>Blessed are those who act justly, <br/>   who always do what is right. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_4">  <sup>4</sup>Remember me, Lord, when you show favor to your people, <br/>   come to my aid when you save them, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_5">  <sup>5</sup>that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones, <br/>   that I may share in the joy of your nation <br/>   and join your inheritance in giving praise. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_6">  <sup>6</sup>We have sinned, even as our ancestors did; <br/>   we have done wrong and acted wickedly. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_7">  <sup>7</sup>When our ancestors were in Egypt, <br/>   they gave no thought to your miracles; <br/>  they did not remember your many kindnesses, <br/>   and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or the Sea of Reeds ; also in verses 9 and 22">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_8">  <sup>8</sup>Yet he saved them for his name’s sake, <br/>   to make his mighty power known. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_9">  <sup>9</sup>He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; <br/>   he led them through the depths as through a desert. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_10">  <sup>10</sup>He saved them from the hand of the foe; <br/>   from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_11">  <sup>11</sup>The waters covered their adversaries; <br/>   not one of them survived. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_12">  <sup>12</sup>Then they believed his promises <br/>   and sang his praise. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_13">  <sup>13</sup>But they soon forgot what he had done <br/>   and did not wait for his plan to unfold. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_14">  <sup>14</sup>In the desert they gave in to their craving; <br/>   in the wilderness they put God to the test. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_15">  <sup>15</sup>So he gave them what they asked for, <br/>   but sent a wasting disease among them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_16">  <sup>16</sup>In the camp they grew envious of Moses <br/>   and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_17">  <sup>17</sup>The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; <br/>   it buried the company of Abiram. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_18">  <sup>18</sup>Fire blazed among their followers; <br/>   a flame consumed the wicked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_19">  <sup>19</sup>At Horeb they made a calf <br/>   and worshiped an idol cast from metal. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_20">  <sup>20</sup>They exchanged their glorious God <br/>   for an image of a bull, which eats grass. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_21">  <sup>21</sup>They forgot the God who saved them, <br/>   who had done great things in Egypt, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_22">  <sup>22</sup>miracles in the land of Ham <br/>   and awesome deeds by the Red Sea. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_23">  <sup>23</sup>So he said he would destroy them— <br/>   had not Moses, his chosen one, <br/>  stood in the breach before him <br/>   to keep his wrath from destroying them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_24">  <sup>24</sup>Then they despised the pleasant land; <br/>   they did not believe his promise. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_25">  <sup>25</sup>They grumbled in their tents <br/>   and did not obey the Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_26">  <sup>26</sup>So he swore to them with uplifted hand <br/>   that he would make them fall in the wilderness, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_27">  <sup>27</sup>make their descendants fall among the nations <br/>   and scatter them throughout the lands. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_28">  <sup>28</sup>They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor <br/>   and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_29">  <sup>29</sup>they aroused the Lord’s anger by their wicked deeds, <br/>   and a plague broke out among them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_30">  <sup>30</sup>But Phinehas stood up and intervened, <br/>   and the plague was checked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_31">  <sup>31</sup>This was credited to him as righteousness <br/>   for endless generations to come. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_32">  <sup>32</sup>By the waters of Meribah they angered the Lord, <br/>   and trouble came to Moses because of them; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_33">  <sup>33</sup>for they rebelled against the Spirit of God, <br/>   and rash words came from Moses’ lips.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or against his spirit, / and rash words came from his lips">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_34">  <sup>34</sup>They did not destroy the peoples <br/>   as the Lord had commanded them, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_35">  <sup>35</sup>but they mingled with the nations <br/>   and adopted their customs. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_36">  <sup>36</sup>They worshiped their idols, <br/>   which became a snare to them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_37">  <sup>37</sup>They sacrificed their sons <br/>   and their daughters to false gods. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_38">  <sup>38</sup>They shed innocent blood, <br/>   the blood of their sons and daughters, <br/>  whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, <br/>   and the land was desecrated by their blood. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_39">  <sup>39</sup>They defiled themselves by what they did; <br/>   by their deeds they prostituted themselves. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_40">  <sup>40</sup>Therefore the Lord was angry with his people <br/>   and abhorred his inheritance. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_41">  <sup>41</sup>He gave them into the hands of the nations, <br/>   and their foes ruled over them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_42">  <sup>42</sup>Their enemies oppressed them <br/>   and subjected them to their power. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_43">  <sup>43</sup>Many times he delivered them, <br/>   but they were bent on rebellion <br/>   and they wasted away in their sin. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_44">  <sup>44</sup>Yet he took note of their distress <br/>   when he heard their cry; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_45">  <sup>45</sup>for their sake he remembered his covenant <br/>   and out of his great love he relented. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_46">  <sup>46</sup>He caused all who held them captive <br/>   to show them mercy. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_47">  <sup>47</sup>Save us, Lord our God, <br/>   and gather us from the nations, <br/>  that we may give thanks to your holy name <br/>   and glory in your praise. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_106_48">  <sup>48</sup>Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, <br/>   from everlasting to everlasting. <br/><br/>  Let all the people say, “Amen!” <br/><br/>  Praise the Lord. <br/></span>
