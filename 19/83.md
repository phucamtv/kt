<div class="title"><h1>83</h1><i>A song. A psalm of Asaph.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_83_1">  <sup>1</sup>O God, do not remain silent; <br/>   do not turn a deaf ear, <br/>   do not stand aloof, O God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_83_2">  <sup>2</sup>See how your enemies growl, <br/>   how your foes rear their heads. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_83_3">  <sup>3</sup>With cunning they conspire against your people; <br/>   they plot against those you cherish. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_83_4">  <sup>4</sup>“Come,” they say, “let us destroy them as a nation, <br/>   so that Israel’s name is remembered no more.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_83_5">  <sup>5</sup>With one mind they plot together; <br/>   they form an alliance against you— <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_83_6">  <sup>6</sup>the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, <br/>   of Moab and the Hagrites, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_83_7">  <sup>7</sup>Byblos, Ammon and Amalek, <br/>   Philistia, with the people of Tyre. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_83_8">  <sup>8</sup>Even Assyria has joined them <br/>   to reinforce Lot’s descendants.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here.">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_83_9">  <sup>9</sup>Do to them as you did to Midian, <br/>   as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_83_10">  <sup>10</sup>who perished at Endor <br/>   and became like dung on the ground. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_83_11">  <sup>11</sup>Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, <br/>   all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_83_12">  <sup>12</sup>who said, “Let us take possession <br/>   of the pasturelands of God.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_83_13">  <sup>13</sup>Make them like tumbleweed, my God, <br/>   like chaff before the wind. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_83_14">  <sup>14</sup>As fire consumes the forest <br/>   or a flame sets the mountains ablaze, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_83_15">  <sup>15</sup>so pursue them with your tempest <br/>   and terrify them with your storm. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_83_16">  <sup>16</sup>Cover their faces with shame, Lord, <br/>   so that they will seek your name. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_83_17">  <sup>17</sup>May they ever be ashamed and dismayed; <br/>   may they perish in disgrace. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_83_18">  <sup>18</sup>Let them know that you, whose name is the Lord— <br/>   that you alone are the Most High over all the earth. <br/></span>
