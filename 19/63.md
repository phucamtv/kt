<span class="verse thi_63_1">  <sup>1</sup>You, God, are my God, <br/>   earnestly I seek you; <br/>  I thirst for you, <br/>   my whole being longs for you, <br/>  in a dry and parched land <br/>   where there is no water. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_63_2">  <sup>2</sup>I have seen you in the sanctuary <br/>   and beheld your power and your glory. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_63_3">  <sup>3</sup>Because your love is better than life, <br/>   my lips will glorify you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_63_4">  <sup>4</sup>I will praise you as long as I live, <br/>   and in your name I will lift up my hands. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_63_5">  <sup>5</sup>I will be fully satisfied as with the richest of foods; <br/>   with singing lips my mouth will praise you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_63_6">  <sup>6</sup>On my bed I remember you; <br/>   I think of you through the watches of the night. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_63_7">  <sup>7</sup>Because you are my help, <br/>   I sing in the shadow of your wings. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_63_8">  <sup>8</sup>I cling to you; <br/>   your right hand upholds me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_63_9">  <sup>9</sup>Those who want to kill me will be destroyed; <br/>   they will go down to the depths of the earth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_63_10">  <sup>10</sup>They will be given over to the sword <br/>   and become food for jackals. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_63_11">  <sup>11</sup>But the king will rejoice in God; <br/>   all who swear by God will glory in him, <br/>   while the mouths of liars will be silenced. <br/></span>
