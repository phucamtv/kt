<div class="title"><h1>62</h1><i>For the director of music. For Jeduthun. A psalm of David.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_62_1">  <sup>1</sup>Truly my soul finds rest in God; <br/>   my salvation comes from him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_62_2">  <sup>2</sup>Truly he is my rock and my salvation; <br/>   he is my fortress, I will never be shaken. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_62_3">  <sup>3</sup>How long will you assault me? <br/>   Would all of you throw me down— <br/>   this leaning wall, this tottering fence? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_62_4">  <sup>4</sup>Surely they intend to topple me <br/>   from my lofty place; <br/>   they take delight in lies. <br/>  With their mouths they bless, <br/>   but in their hearts they curse.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here and at the end of verse 8.">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_62_5">  <sup>5</sup>Yes, my soul, find rest in God; <br/>   my hope comes from him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_62_6">  <sup>6</sup>Truly he is my rock and my salvation; <br/>   he is my fortress, I will not be shaken. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_62_7">  <sup>7</sup>My salvation and my honor depend on God<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or / God Most High is my salvation and my honor">⚓</a> ; <br/>   he is my mighty rock, my refuge. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_62_8">  <sup>8</sup>Trust in him at all times, you people; <br/>   pour out your hearts to him, <br/>   for God is our refuge. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_62_9">  <sup>9</sup>Surely the lowborn are but a breath, <br/>   the highborn are but a lie. <br/>  If weighed on a balance, they are nothing; <br/>   together they are only a breath. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_62_10">  <sup>10</sup>Do not trust in extortion <br/>   or put vain hope in stolen goods; <br/>  though your riches increase, <br/>   do not set your heart on them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_62_11">  <sup>11</sup>One thing God has spoken, <br/>   two things I have heard: <br/>  “Power belongs to you, God, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_62_12">   <sup>12</sup>and with you, Lord, is unfailing love”; <br/>  and, “You reward everyone <br/>   according to what they have done.” <br/></span>
