<span class="verse thi_103_1">  <sup>1</sup>Praise the Lord, my soul; <br/>   all my inmost being, praise his holy name. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_2">  <sup>2</sup>Praise the Lord, my soul, <br/>   and forget not all his benefits— <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_3">  <sup>3</sup>who forgives all your sins <br/>   and heals all your diseases, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_4">  <sup>4</sup>who redeems your life from the pit <br/>   and crowns you with love and compassion, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_5">  <sup>5</sup>who satisfies your desires with good things <br/>   so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_6">  <sup>6</sup>The Lord works righteousness <br/>   and justice for all the oppressed. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_7">  <sup>7</sup>He made known his ways to Moses, <br/>   his deeds to the people of Israel: <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_8">  <sup>8</sup>The Lord is compassionate and gracious, <br/>   slow to anger, abounding in love. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_9">  <sup>9</sup>He will not always accuse, <br/>   nor will he harbor his anger forever; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_10">  <sup>10</sup>he does not treat us as our sins deserve <br/>   or repay us according to our iniquities. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_11">  <sup>11</sup>For as high as the heavens are above the earth, <br/>   so great is his love for those who fear him; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_12">  <sup>12</sup>as far as the east is from the west, <br/>   so far has he removed our transgressions from us. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_13">  <sup>13</sup>As a father has compassion on his children, <br/>   so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_14">  <sup>14</sup>for he knows how we are formed, <br/>   he remembers that we are dust. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_15">  <sup>15</sup>The life of mortals is like grass, <br/>   they flourish like a flower of the field; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_16">  <sup>16</sup>the wind blows over it and it is gone, <br/>   and its place remembers it no more. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_17">  <sup>17</sup>But from everlasting to everlasting <br/>   the Lord’s love is with those who fear him, <br/>   and his righteousness with their children’s children— <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_18">  <sup>18</sup>with those who keep his covenant <br/>   and remember to obey his precepts. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_19">  <sup>19</sup>The Lord has established his throne in heaven, <br/>   and his kingdom rules over all. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_20">  <sup>20</sup>Praise the Lord, you his angels, <br/>   you mighty ones who do his bidding, <br/>   who obey his word. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_21">  <sup>21</sup>Praise the Lord, all his heavenly hosts, <br/>   you his servants who do his will. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_103_22">  <sup>22</sup>Praise the Lord, all his works <br/>   everywhere in his dominion. <br/><br/>  Praise the Lord, my soul. <br/></span>
