<span class="verse thi_94_1">  <sup>1</sup>The Lord is a God who avenges. <br/>   O God who avenges, shine forth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_2">  <sup>2</sup>Rise up, Judge of the earth; <br/>   pay back to the proud what they deserve. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_3">  <sup>3</sup>How long, Lord, will the wicked, <br/>   how long will the wicked be jubilant? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_4">  <sup>4</sup>They pour out arrogant words; <br/>   all the evildoers are full of boasting. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_5">  <sup>5</sup>They crush your people, Lord; <br/>   they oppress your inheritance. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_6">  <sup>6</sup>They slay the widow and the foreigner; <br/>   they murder the fatherless. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_7">  <sup>7</sup>They say, “The Lord does not see; <br/>   the God of Jacob takes no notice.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_8">  <sup>8</sup>Take notice, you senseless ones among the people; <br/>   you fools, when will you become wise? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_9">  <sup>9</sup>Does he who fashioned the ear not hear? <br/>   Does he who formed the eye not see? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_10">  <sup>10</sup>Does he who disciplines nations not punish? <br/>   Does he who teaches mankind lack knowledge? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_11">  <sup>11</sup>The Lord knows all human plans; <br/>   he knows that they are futile. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_12">  <sup>12</sup>Blessed is the one you discipline, Lord, <br/>   the one you teach from your law; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_13">  <sup>13</sup>you grant them relief from days of trouble, <br/>   till a pit is dug for the wicked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_14">  <sup>14</sup>For the Lord will not reject his people; <br/>   he will never forsake his inheritance. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_15">  <sup>15</sup>Judgment will again be founded on righteousness, <br/>   and all the upright in heart will follow it. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_16">  <sup>16</sup>Who will rise up for me against the wicked? <br/>   Who will take a stand for me against evildoers? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_17">  <sup>17</sup>Unless the Lord had given me help, <br/>   I would soon have dwelt in the silence of death. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_18">  <sup>18</sup>When I said, “My foot is slipping,” <br/>   your unfailing love, Lord, supported me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_19">  <sup>19</sup>When anxiety was great within me, <br/>   your consolation brought me joy. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_20">  <sup>20</sup>Can a corrupt throne be allied with you— <br/>   a throne that brings on misery by its decrees? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_21">  <sup>21</sup>The wicked band together against the righteous <br/>   and condemn the innocent to death. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_22">  <sup>22</sup>But the Lord has become my fortress, <br/>   and my God the rock in whom I take refuge. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_94_23">  <sup>23</sup>He will repay them for their sins <br/>   and destroy them for their wickedness; <br/>   the Lord our God will destroy them. <br/></span>
