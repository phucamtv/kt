<div class="title"><h1>101</h1><i>Of David. A psalm.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_101_1">  <sup>1</sup>I will sing of your love and justice; <br/>   to you, Lord, I will sing praise. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_101_2">  <sup>2</sup>I will be careful to lead a blameless life— <br/>   when will you come to me? <br/><br/>  I will conduct the affairs of my house <br/>   with a blameless heart. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_101_3">  <sup>3</sup>I will not look with approval <br/>   on anything that is vile. <br/><br/>  I hate what faithless people do; <br/>   I will have no part in it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_101_4">  <sup>4</sup>The perverse of heart shall be far from me; <br/>   I will have nothing to do with what is evil. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_101_5">  <sup>5</sup>Whoever slanders their neighbor in secret, <br/>   I will put to silence; <br/>  whoever has haughty eyes and a proud heart, <br/>   I will not tolerate. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_101_6">  <sup>6</sup>My eyes will be on the faithful in the land, <br/>   that they may dwell with me; <br/>  the one whose walk is blameless <br/>   will minister to me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_101_7">  <sup>7</sup>No one who practices deceit <br/>   will dwell in my house; <br/>  no one who speaks falsely <br/>   will stand in my presence. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_101_8">  <sup>8</sup>Every morning I will put to silence <br/>   all the wicked in the land; <br/>  I will cut off every evildoer <br/>   from the city of the Lord. <br/></span>
