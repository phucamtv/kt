<span class="verse thi_74_1">  <sup>1</sup>O God, why have you rejected us forever? <br/>   Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_2">  <sup>2</sup>Remember the nation you purchased long ago, <br/>   the people of your inheritance, whom you redeemed— <br/>   Mount Zion, where you dwelt. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_3">  <sup>3</sup>Turn your steps toward these everlasting ruins, <br/>   all this destruction the enemy has brought on the sanctuary. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_4">  <sup>4</sup>Your foes roared in the place where you met with us; <br/>   they set up their standards as signs. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_5">  <sup>5</sup>They behaved like men wielding axes <br/>   to cut through a thicket of trees. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_6">  <sup>6</sup>They smashed all the carved paneling <br/>   with their axes and hatchets. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_7">  <sup>7</sup>They burned your sanctuary to the ground; <br/>   they defiled the dwelling place of your Name. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_8">  <sup>8</sup>They said in their hearts, “We will crush them completely!” <br/>   They burned every place where God was worshiped in the land. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_9">  <sup>9</sup>We are given no signs from God; <br/>   no prophets are left, <br/>   and none of us knows how long this will be. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_10">  <sup>10</sup>How long will the enemy mock you, God? <br/>   Will the foe revile your name forever? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_11">  <sup>11</sup>Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand? <br/>   Take it from the folds of your garment and destroy them! <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_12">  <sup>12</sup>But God is my King from long ago; <br/>   he brings salvation on the earth. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_13">  <sup>13</sup>It was you who split open the sea by your power; <br/>   you broke the heads of the monster in the waters. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_14">  <sup>14</sup>It was you who crushed the heads of Leviathan <br/>   and gave it as food to the creatures of the desert. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_15">  <sup>15</sup>It was you who opened up springs and streams; <br/>   you dried up the ever-flowing rivers. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_16">  <sup>16</sup>The day is yours, and yours also the night; <br/>   you established the sun and moon. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_17">  <sup>17</sup>It was you who set all the boundaries of the earth; <br/>   you made both summer and winter. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_18">  <sup>18</sup>Remember how the enemy has mocked you, Lord, <br/>   how foolish people have reviled your name. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_19">  <sup>19</sup>Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts; <br/>   do not forget the lives of your afflicted people forever. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_20">  <sup>20</sup>Have regard for your covenant, <br/>   because haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_21">  <sup>21</sup>Do not let the oppressed retreat in disgrace; <br/>   may the poor and needy praise your name. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_22">  <sup>22</sup>Rise up, O God, and defend your cause; <br/>   remember how fools mock you all day long. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_74_23">  <sup>23</sup>Do not ignore the clamor of your adversaries, <br/>   the uproar of your enemies, which rises continually. <br/></span>
