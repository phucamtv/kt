<span class="verse thi_115_1">  <sup>1</sup>Not to us, Lord, not to us <br/>   but to your name be the glory, <br/>   because of your love and faithfulness. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_115_2">  <sup>2</sup>Why do the nations say, <br/>   “Where is their God?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_115_3">  <sup>3</sup>Our God is in heaven; <br/>   he does whatever pleases him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_115_4">  <sup>4</sup>But their idols are silver and gold, <br/>   made by human hands. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_115_5">  <sup>5</sup>They have mouths, but cannot speak, <br/>   eyes, but cannot see. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_115_6">  <sup>6</sup>They have ears, but cannot hear, <br/>   noses, but cannot smell. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_115_7">  <sup>7</sup>They have hands, but cannot feel, <br/>   feet, but cannot walk, <br/>   nor can they utter a sound with their throats. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_115_8">  <sup>8</sup>Those who make them will be like them, <br/>   and so will all who trust in them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_115_9">  <sup>9</sup>All you Israelites, trust in the Lord— <br/>   he is their help and shield. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_115_10">  <sup>10</sup>House of Aaron, trust in the Lord— <br/>   he is their help and shield. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_115_11">  <sup>11</sup>You who fear him, trust in the Lord— <br/>   he is their help and shield. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_115_12">  <sup>12</sup>The Lord remembers us and will bless us: <br/>   He will bless his people Israel, <br/>   he will bless the house of Aaron, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_115_13">  <sup>13</sup>he will bless those who fear the Lord— <br/>   small and great alike. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_115_14">  <sup>14</sup>May the Lord cause you to flourish, <br/>   both you and your children. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_115_15">  <sup>15</sup>May you be blessed by the Lord, <br/>   the Maker of heaven and earth. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_115_16">  <sup>16</sup>The highest heavens belong to the Lord, <br/>   but the earth he has given to mankind. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_115_17">  <sup>17</sup>It is not the dead who praise the Lord, <br/>   those who go down to the place of silence; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_115_18">  <sup>18</sup>it is we who extol the Lord, <br/>   both now and forevermore. <br/><br/>  Praise the Lord.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew Hallelu Yah">⚓</a><br/></span>
