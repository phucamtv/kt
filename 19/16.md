<span class="verse thi_16_1">  <sup>1</sup>Keep me safe, my God, <br/>   for in you I take refuge. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_16_2">  <sup>2</sup>I say to the Lord, “You are my Lord; <br/>   apart from you I have no good thing.” <br/></span>

<span class="verse thi_16_4">  <sup>4</sup>Those who run after other gods will suffer more and more. <br/>   I will not pour out libations of blood to such gods <br/>   or take up their names on my lips. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_16_5">  <sup>5</sup>Lord, you alone are my portion and my cup; <br/>   you make my lot secure. <br/></span>

<span class="verse thi_16_10">  <sup>10</sup>because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, <br/>   nor will you let your faithful<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or holy">⚓</a> one see decay. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_16_11">  <sup>11</sup>You make known to me the path of life; <br/>   you will fill me with joy in your presence, <br/>   with eternal pleasures at your right hand. <br/></span>
