<span class="verse thi_140_3">  <sup>3</sup>They make their tongues as sharp as a serpent’s; <br/>   the poison of vipers is on their lips.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here and at the end of verses 5 and 8.">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_140_4">  <sup>4</sup>Keep me safe, Lord, from the hands of the wicked; <br/>   protect me from the violent, <br/>   who devise ways to trip my feet. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_140_5">  <sup>5</sup>The arrogant have hidden a snare for me; <br/>   they have spread out the cords of their net <br/>   and have set traps for me along my path. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_140_6">  <sup>6</sup>I say to the Lord, “You are my God.” <br/>   Hear, Lord, my cry for mercy. <br/></span>

<span class="verse thi_140_10">  <sup>10</sup>May burning coals fall on them; <br/>   may they be thrown into the fire, <br/>   into miry pits, never to rise. <br/></span>
