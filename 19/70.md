<span class="verse thi_70_1">  <sup>1</sup>Hasten, O God, to save me; <br/>   come quickly, Lord, to help me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_70_2">  <sup>2</sup>May those who want to take my life <br/>   be put to shame and confusion; <br/>  may all who desire my ruin <br/>   be turned back in disgrace. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_70_3">  <sup>3</sup>May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” <br/>   turn back because of their shame. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_70_4">  <sup>4</sup>But may all who seek you <br/>   rejoice and be glad in you; <br/>  may those who long for your saving help always say, <br/>   “The Lord is great!” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_70_5">  <sup>5</sup>But as for me, I am poor and needy; <br/>   come quickly to me, O God. <br/>  You are my help and my deliverer; <br/>   Lord, do not delay. <br/></span>
