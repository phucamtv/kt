<div class="title"><h1>77</h1><i>For the director of music. For Jeduthun. Of Asaph. A psalm.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_77_1">  <sup>1</sup>I cried out to God for help; <br/>   I cried out to God to hear me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_77_2">  <sup>2</sup>When I was in distress, I sought the Lord; <br/>   at night I stretched out untiring hands, <br/>   and I would not be comforted. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_77_3">  <sup>3</sup>I remembered you, God, and I groaned; <br/>   I meditated, and my spirit grew faint.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here and at the end of verses 9 and 15.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_77_4">  <sup>4</sup>You kept my eyes from closing; <br/>   I was too troubled to speak. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_77_5">  <sup>5</sup>I thought about the former days, <br/>   the years of long ago; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_77_6">  <sup>6</sup>I remembered my songs in the night. <br/>   My heart meditated and my spirit asked: <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_77_7">  <sup>7</sup>“Will the Lord reject forever? <br/>   Will he never show his favor again? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_77_8">  <sup>8</sup>Has his unfailing love vanished forever? <br/>   Has his promise failed for all time? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_77_9">  <sup>9</sup>Has God forgotten to be merciful? <br/>   Has he in anger withheld his compassion?” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_77_10">  <sup>10</sup>Then I thought, “To this I will appeal: <br/>   the years when the Most High stretched out his right hand. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_77_11">  <sup>11</sup>I will remember the deeds of the Lord; <br/>   yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_77_12">  <sup>12</sup>I will consider all your works <br/>   and meditate on all your mighty deeds.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_77_13">  <sup>13</sup>Your ways, God, are holy. <br/>   What god is as great as our God? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_77_14">  <sup>14</sup>You are the God who performs miracles; <br/>   you display your power among the peoples. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_77_15">  <sup>15</sup>With your mighty arm you redeemed your people, <br/>   the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_77_16">  <sup>16</sup>The waters saw you, God, <br/>   the waters saw you and writhed; <br/>   the very depths were convulsed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_77_17">  <sup>17</sup>The clouds poured down water, <br/>   the heavens resounded with thunder; <br/>   your arrows flashed back and forth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_77_18">  <sup>18</sup>Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind, <br/>   your lightning lit up the world; <br/>   the earth trembled and quaked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_77_19">  <sup>19</sup>Your path led through the sea, <br/>   your way through the mighty waters, <br/>   though your footprints were not seen. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_77_20">  <sup>20</sup>You led your people like a flock <br/>   by the hand of Moses and Aaron. <br/></span>
