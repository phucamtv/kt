<span class="verse thi_9_2">  <sup>2</sup>I will be glad and rejoice in you; <br/>   I will sing the praises of your name, O Most High. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_9_3">  <sup>3</sup>My enemies turn back; <br/>   they stumble and perish before you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_9_4">  <sup>4</sup>For you have upheld my right and my cause, <br/>   sitting enthroned as the righteous judge. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_9_5">  <sup>5</sup>You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked; <br/>   you have blotted out their name for ever and ever. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_9_6">  <sup>6</sup>Endless ruin has overtaken my enemies, <br/>   you have uprooted their cities; <br/>   even the memory of them has perished. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_9_7">  <sup>7</sup>The Lord reigns forever; <br/>   he has established his throne for judgment. <br/></span>

<span class="verse thi_9_13">  <sup>13</sup>Lord, see how my enemies persecute me! <br/>   Have mercy and lift me up from the gates of death, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_9_14">  <sup>14</sup>that I may declare your praises <br/>   in the gates of Daughter Zion, <br/>   and there rejoice in your salvation. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_9_15">  <sup>15</sup>The nations have fallen into the pit they have dug; <br/>   their feet are caught in the net they have hidden. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_9_16">  <sup>16</sup>The Lord is known by his acts of justice; <br/>   the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Higgaion and Selah (words of uncertain meaning) here; Selah occurs also at the end of verse 20.">⚓</a><br/></span>

<span class="verse thi_9_20">  <sup>20</sup>Strike them with terror, Lord; <br/>   let the nations know they are only mortal. <br/></span>
