<span class="verse thi_21_1">  <sup>1</sup>The king rejoices in your strength, Lord. <br/>   How great is his joy in the victories you give! <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_21_2">  <sup>2</sup>You have granted him his heart’s desire <br/>   and have not withheld the request of his lips.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_21_3">  <sup>3</sup>You came to greet him with rich blessings <br/>   and placed a crown of pure gold on his head. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_21_4">  <sup>4</sup>He asked you for life, and you gave it to him— <br/>   length of days, for ever and ever. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_21_5">  <sup>5</sup>Through the victories you gave, his glory is great; <br/>   you have bestowed on him splendor and majesty. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_21_6">  <sup>6</sup>Surely you have granted him unending blessings <br/>   and made him glad with the joy of your presence. <br/></span>

<span class="verse thi_21_8">  <sup>8</sup>Your hand will lay hold on all your enemies; <br/>   your right hand will seize your foes. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_21_9">  <sup>9</sup>When you appear for battle, <br/>   you will burn them up as in a blazing furnace. <br/>  The Lord will swallow them up in his wrath, <br/>   and his fire will consume them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_21_10">  <sup>10</sup>You will destroy their descendants from the earth, <br/>   their posterity from mankind. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_21_11">  <sup>11</sup>Though they plot evil against you <br/>   and devise wicked schemes, they cannot succeed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_21_12">  <sup>12</sup>You will make them turn their backs <br/>   when you aim at them with drawn bow. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_21_13">  <sup>13</sup>Be exalted in your strength, Lord; <br/>   we will sing and praise your might. <br/></span>
