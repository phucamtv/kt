<span class="verse thi_114_3">  <sup>3</sup>The sea looked and fled, <br/>   the Jordan turned back; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_114_4">  <sup>4</sup>the mountains leaped like rams, <br/>   the hills like lambs. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_114_5">  <sup>5</sup>Why was it, sea, that you fled? <br/>   Why, Jordan, did you turn back? <br/></span>
