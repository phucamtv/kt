<div class="title"><h1>39</h1><i>For the director of music. For Jeduthun. A psalm of David.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_39_1">  <sup>1</sup>I said, “I will watch my ways <br/>   and keep my tongue from sin; <br/>  I will put a muzzle on my mouth <br/>   while in the presence of the wicked.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_39_2">  <sup>2</sup>So I remained utterly silent, <br/>   not even saying anything good. <br/>  But my anguish increased; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_39_3">   <sup>3</sup>my heart grew hot within me. <br/>  While I meditated, the fire burned; <br/>   then I spoke with my tongue: <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_39_4">  <sup>4</sup>“Show me, Lord, my life’s end <br/>   and the number of my days; <br/>   let me know how fleeting my life is. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_39_5">  <sup>5</sup>You have made my days a mere handbreadth; <br/>   the span of my years is as nothing before you. <br/>  Everyone is but a breath, <br/>   even those who seem secure.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here and at the end of verse 11.">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_39_6">  <sup>6</sup>“Surely everyone goes around like a mere phantom; <br/>   in vain they rush about, heaping up wealth <br/>   without knowing whose it will finally be. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_39_7">  <sup>7</sup>“But now, Lord, what do I look for? <br/>   My hope is in you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_39_8">  <sup>8</sup>Save me from all my transgressions; <br/>   do not make me the scorn of fools. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_39_9">  <sup>9</sup>I was silent; I would not open my mouth, <br/>   for you are the one who has done this. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_39_10">  <sup>10</sup>Remove your scourge from me; <br/>   I am overcome by the blow of your hand. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_39_11">  <sup>11</sup>When you rebuke and discipline anyone for their sin, <br/>   you consume their wealth like a moth— <br/>   surely everyone is but a breath. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_39_12">  <sup>12</sup>“Hear my prayer, Lord, <br/>   listen to my cry for help; <br/>   do not be deaf to my weeping. <br/>  I dwell with you as a foreigner, <br/>   a stranger, as all my ancestors were. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_39_13">  <sup>13</sup>Look away from me, that I may enjoy life again <br/>   before I depart and am no more.” <br/></span>
