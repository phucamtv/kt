<div class="title"><h1>64</h1><i>For the director of music. A psalm of David.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_64_1">  <sup>1</sup>Hear me, my God, as I voice my complaint; <br/>   protect my life from the threat of the enemy. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_64_2">  <sup>2</sup>Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, <br/>   from the plots of evildoers. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_64_3">  <sup>3</sup>They sharpen their tongues like swords <br/>   and aim cruel words like deadly arrows. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_64_4">  <sup>4</sup>They shoot from ambush at the innocent; <br/>   they shoot suddenly, without fear. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_64_5">  <sup>5</sup>They encourage each other in evil plans, <br/>   they talk about hiding their snares; <br/>   they say, “Who will see it<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or us">⚓</a> ?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_64_6">  <sup>6</sup>They plot injustice and say, <br/>   “We have devised a perfect plan!” <br/>   Surely the human mind and heart are cunning. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_64_7">  <sup>7</sup>But God will shoot them with his arrows; <br/>   they will suddenly be struck down. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_64_8">  <sup>8</sup>He will turn their own tongues against them <br/>   and bring them to ruin; <br/>   all who see them will shake their heads in scorn. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_64_9">  <sup>9</sup>All people will fear; <br/>   they will proclaim the works of God <br/>   and ponder what he has done. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_64_10">  <sup>10</sup>The righteous will rejoice in the Lord<br/>   and take refuge in him; <br/>   all the upright in heart will glory in him! <br/></span>
