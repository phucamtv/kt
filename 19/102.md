<div class="title"><h1>102</h1><i>A prayer of an afflicted person who has grown weak and pours out a lament before the Lord.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_102_1">  <sup>1</sup>Hear my prayer, Lord; <br/>   let my cry for help come to you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_2">  <sup>2</sup>Do not hide your face from me <br/>   when I am in distress. <br/>  Turn your ear to me; <br/>   when I call, answer me quickly. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_3">  <sup>3</sup>For my days vanish like smoke; <br/>   my bones burn like glowing embers. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_4">  <sup>4</sup>My heart is blighted and withered like grass; <br/>   I forget to eat my food. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_5">  <sup>5</sup>In my distress I groan aloud <br/>   and am reduced to skin and bones. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_6">  <sup>6</sup>I am like a desert owl, <br/>   like an owl among the ruins. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_7">  <sup>7</sup>I lie awake; I have become <br/>   like a bird alone on a roof. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_8">  <sup>8</sup>All day long my enemies taunt me; <br/>   those who rail against me use my name as a curse. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_9">  <sup>9</sup>For I eat ashes as my food <br/>   and mingle my drink with tears <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_10">  <sup>10</sup>because of your great wrath, <br/>   for you have taken me up and thrown me aside. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_11">  <sup>11</sup>My days are like the evening shadow; <br/>   I wither away like grass. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_12">  <sup>12</sup>But you, Lord, sit enthroned forever; <br/>   your renown endures through all generations. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_13">  <sup>13</sup>You will arise and have compassion on Zion, <br/>   for it is time to show favor to her; <br/>   the appointed time has come. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_14">  <sup>14</sup>For her stones are dear to your servants; <br/>   her very dust moves them to pity. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_15">  <sup>15</sup>The nations will fear the name of the Lord, <br/>   all the kings of the earth will revere your glory. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_16">  <sup>16</sup>For the Lord will rebuild Zion <br/>   and appear in his glory. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_17">  <sup>17</sup>He will respond to the prayer of the destitute; <br/>   he will not despise their plea. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_18">  <sup>18</sup>Let this be written for a future generation, <br/>   that a people not yet created may praise the Lord: <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_19">  <sup>19</sup>“The Lord looked down from his sanctuary on high, <br/>   from heaven he viewed the earth, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_20">  <sup>20</sup>to hear the groans of the prisoners <br/>   and release those condemned to death.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_21">  <sup>21</sup>So the name of the Lord will be declared in Zion <br/>   and his praise in Jerusalem <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_22">  <sup>22</sup>when the peoples and the kingdoms <br/>   assemble to worship the Lord. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_23">  <sup>23</sup>In the course of my life<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or By his power">⚓</a> he broke my strength; <br/>   he cut short my days. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_24">  <sup>24</sup>So I said: <br/>  “Do not take me away, my God, in the midst of my days; <br/>   your years go on through all generations. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_25">  <sup>25</sup>In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth, <br/>   and the heavens are the work of your hands. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_26">  <sup>26</sup>They will perish, but you remain; <br/>   they will all wear out like a garment. <br/>  Like clothing you will change them <br/>   and they will be discarded. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_27">  <sup>27</sup>But you remain the same, <br/>   and your years will never end. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_102_28">  <sup>28</sup>The children of your servants will live in your presence; <br/>   their descendants will be established before you.” <br/></span>
