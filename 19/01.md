<div class="title"><h1>1</h1><p>BOOK I </p><p>Psalms 1–41 </p></div>
<span class="verse thi_1_1">  <sup>1</sup>Blessed is the one <br/>   who does not walk in step with the wicked <br/>  or stand in the way that sinners take <br/>   or sit in the company of mockers, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_1_2">  <sup>2</sup>but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, <br/>   and who meditates on his law day and night. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_1_3">  <sup>3</sup>That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, <br/>   which yields its fruit in season <br/>  and whose leaf does not wither— <br/>   whatever they do prospers. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_1_4">  <sup>4</sup>Not so the wicked! <br/>   They are like chaff <br/>   that the wind blows away. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_1_5">  <sup>5</sup>Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, <br/>   nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_1_6">  <sup>6</sup>For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, <br/>   but the way of the wicked leads to destruction. <br/></span>
