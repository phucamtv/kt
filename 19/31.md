<span class="verse thi_31_1">  <sup>1</sup>In you, Lord, I have taken refuge; <br/>   let me never be put to shame; <br/>   deliver me in your righteousness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_2">  <sup>2</sup>Turn your ear to me, <br/>   come quickly to my rescue; <br/>  be my rock of refuge, <br/>   a strong fortress to save me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_3">  <sup>3</sup>Since you are my rock and my fortress, <br/>   for the sake of your name lead and guide me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_4">  <sup>4</sup>Keep me free from the trap that is set for me, <br/>   for you are my refuge. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_5">  <sup>5</sup>Into your hands I commit my spirit; <br/>   deliver me, Lord, my faithful God. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_6">  <sup>6</sup>I hate those who cling to worthless idols; <br/>   as for me, I trust in the Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_7">  <sup>7</sup>I will be glad and rejoice in your love, <br/>   for you saw my affliction <br/>   and knew the anguish of my soul. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_8">  <sup>8</sup>You have not given me into the hands of the enemy <br/>   but have set my feet in a spacious place. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_9">  <sup>9</sup>Be merciful to me, Lord, for I am in distress; <br/>   my eyes grow weak with sorrow, <br/>   my soul and body with grief. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_10">  <sup>10</sup>My life is consumed by anguish <br/>   and my years by groaning; <br/>  my strength fails because of my affliction,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or guilt">⚓</a><br/>   and my bones grow weak. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_11">  <sup>11</sup>Because of all my enemies, <br/>   I am the utter contempt of my neighbors <br/>  and an object of dread to my closest friends— <br/>   those who see me on the street flee from me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_12">  <sup>12</sup>I am forgotten as though I were dead; <br/>   I have become like broken pottery. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_13">  <sup>13</sup>For I hear many whispering, <br/>   “Terror on every side!” <br/>  They conspire against me <br/>   and plot to take my life. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_14">  <sup>14</sup>But I trust in you, Lord; <br/>   I say, “You are my God.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_15">  <sup>15</sup>My times are in your hands; <br/>   deliver me from the hands of my enemies, <br/>   from those who pursue me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_16">  <sup>16</sup>Let your face shine on your servant; <br/>   save me in your unfailing love. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_17">  <sup>17</sup>Let me not be put to shame, Lord, <br/>   for I have cried out to you; <br/>  but let the wicked be put to shame <br/>   and be silent in the realm of the dead. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_18">  <sup>18</sup>Let their lying lips be silenced, <br/>   for with pride and contempt <br/>   they speak arrogantly against the righteous. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_19">  <sup>19</sup>How abundant are the good things <br/>   that you have stored up for those who fear you, <br/>  that you bestow in the sight of all, <br/>   on those who take refuge in you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_20">  <sup>20</sup>In the shelter of your presence you hide them <br/>   from all human intrigues; <br/>  you keep them safe in your dwelling <br/>   from accusing tongues. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_21">  <sup>21</sup>Praise be to the Lord, <br/>   for he showed me the wonders of his love <br/>   when I was in a city under siege. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_22">  <sup>22</sup>In my alarm I said, <br/>   “I am cut off from your sight!” <br/>  Yet you heard my cry for mercy <br/>   when I called to you for help. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_23">  <sup>23</sup>Love the Lord, all his faithful people! <br/>   The Lord preserves those who are true to him, <br/>   but the proud he pays back in full. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_31_24">  <sup>24</sup>Be strong and take heart, <br/>   all you who hope in the Lord. <br/></span>
