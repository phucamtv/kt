<div class="title"><h1>139</h1><i>For the director of music. Of David. A psalm.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_139_1">  <sup>1</sup>You have searched me, Lord, <br/>   and you know me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_2">  <sup>2</sup>You know when I sit and when I rise; <br/>   you perceive my thoughts from afar. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_3">  <sup>3</sup>You discern my going out and my lying down; <br/>   you are familiar with all my ways. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_4">  <sup>4</sup>Before a word is on my tongue <br/>   you, Lord, know it completely. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_5">  <sup>5</sup>You hem me in behind and before, <br/>   and you lay your hand upon me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_6">  <sup>6</sup>Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, <br/>   too lofty for me to attain. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_7">  <sup>7</sup>Where can I go from your Spirit? <br/>   Where can I flee from your presence? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_8">  <sup>8</sup>If I go up to the heavens, you are there; <br/>   if I make my bed in the depths, you are there. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_9">  <sup>9</sup>If I rise on the wings of the dawn, <br/>   if I settle on the far side of the sea, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_10">  <sup>10</sup>even there your hand will guide me, <br/>   your right hand will hold me fast. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_11">  <sup>11</sup>If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me <br/>   and the light become night around me,” <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_12">  <sup>12</sup>even the darkness will not be dark to you; <br/>   the night will shine like the day, <br/>   for darkness is as light to you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_13">  <sup>13</sup>For you created my inmost being; <br/>   you knit me together in my mother’s womb. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_14">  <sup>14</sup>I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; <br/>   your works are wonderful, <br/>   I know that full well. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_15">  <sup>15</sup>My frame was not hidden from you <br/>   when I was made in the secret place, <br/>   when I was woven together in the depths of the earth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_16">  <sup>16</sup>Your eyes saw my unformed body; <br/>   all the days ordained for me were written in your book <br/>   before one of them came to be. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_17">  <sup>17</sup>How precious to me are your thoughts,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or How amazing are your thoughts concerning me">⚓</a> God! <br/>   How vast is the sum of them! <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_18">  <sup>18</sup>Were I to count them, <br/>   they would outnumber the grains of sand— <br/>   when I awake, I am still with you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_19">  <sup>19</sup>If only you, God, would slay the wicked! <br/>   Away from me, you who are bloodthirsty! <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_20">  <sup>20</sup>They speak of you with evil intent; <br/>   your adversaries misuse your name. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_21">  <sup>21</sup>Do I not hate those who hate you, Lord, <br/>   and abhor those who are in rebellion against you? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_22">  <sup>22</sup>I have nothing but hatred for them; <br/>   I count them my enemies. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_23">  <sup>23</sup>Search me, God, and know my heart; <br/>   test me and know my anxious thoughts. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_139_24">  <sup>24</sup>See if there is any offensive way in me, <br/>   and lead me in the way everlasting. <br/></span>
