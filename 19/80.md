<span class="verse thi_80_1">  <sup>1</sup>Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, <br/>   you who lead Joseph like a flock. <br/>  You who sit enthroned between the cherubim, <br/>   shine forth </span>
<span class="verse thi_80_2">   <sup>2</sup>before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh. <br/>  Awaken your might; <br/>   come and save us. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_80_3">  <sup>3</sup>Restore us, O God; <br/>   make your face shine on us, <br/>   that we may be saved. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_80_4">  <sup>4</sup>How long, Lord God Almighty, <br/>   will your anger smolder <br/>   against the prayers of your people? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_80_5">  <sup>5</sup>You have fed them with the bread of tears; <br/>   you have made them drink tears by the bowlful. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_80_6">  <sup>6</sup>You have made us an object of derision<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Probable reading of the original Hebrew text; Masoretic Text contention">⚓</a> to our neighbors, <br/>   and our enemies mock us. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_80_7">  <sup>7</sup>Restore us, God Almighty; <br/>   make your face shine on us, <br/>   that we may be saved. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_80_8">  <sup>8</sup>You transplanted a vine from Egypt; <br/>   you drove out the nations and planted it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_80_9">  <sup>9</sup>You cleared the ground for it, <br/>   and it took root and filled the land. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_80_10">  <sup>10</sup>The mountains were covered with its shade, <br/>   the mighty cedars with its branches. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_80_11">  <sup>11</sup>Its branches reached as far as the Sea,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Probably the Mediterranean">⚓</a><br/>   its shoots as far as the River.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, the Euphrates">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_80_12">  <sup>12</sup>Why have you broken down its walls <br/>   so that all who pass by pick its grapes? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_80_13">  <sup>13</sup>Boars from the forest ravage it, <br/>   and insects from the fields feed on it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_80_14">  <sup>14</sup>Return to us, God Almighty! <br/>   Look down from heaven and see! <br/>  Watch over this vine, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_80_15">   <sup>15</sup>the root your right hand has planted, <br/>   the son<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or branch">⚓</a> you have raised up for yourself. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_80_16">  <sup>16</sup>Your vine is cut down, it is burned with fire; <br/>   at your rebuke your people perish. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_80_17">  <sup>17</sup>Let your hand rest on the man at your right hand, <br/>   the son of man you have raised up for yourself. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_80_18">  <sup>18</sup>Then we will not turn away from you; <br/>   revive us, and we will call on your name. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_80_19">  <sup>19</sup>Restore us, Lord God Almighty; <br/>   make your face shine on us, <br/>   that we may be saved. <br/></span>
