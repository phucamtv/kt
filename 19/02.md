<span class="verse thi_2_1">  <sup>1</sup>Why do the nations conspire<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew; Septuagint rage">⚓</a><br/>   and the peoples plot in vain? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_2_2">  <sup>2</sup>The kings of the earth rise up <br/>   and the rulers band together <br/>   against the Lord and against his anointed, saying, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_2_3">  <sup>3</sup>“Let us break their chains <br/>   and throw off their shackles.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_2_4">  <sup>4</sup>The One enthroned in heaven laughs; <br/>   the Lord scoffs at them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_2_5">  <sup>5</sup>He rebukes them in his anger <br/>   and terrifies them in his wrath, saying, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_2_6">  <sup>6</sup>“I have installed my king <br/>   on Zion, my holy mountain.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_2_7"> <sup>7</sup>I will proclaim the Lord’s decree: <br/>  He said to me, “You are my son; <br/>   today I have become your father. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_2_8">  <sup>8</sup>Ask me, <br/>   and I will make the nations your inheritance, <br/>   the ends of the earth your possession. <br/></span>

<span class="verse thi_2_10">  <sup>10</sup>Therefore, you kings, be wise; <br/>   be warned, you rulers of the earth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_2_11">  <sup>11</sup>Serve the Lord with fear <br/>   and celebrate his rule with trembling. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_2_12">  <sup>12</sup>Kiss his son, or he will be angry <br/>   and your way will lead to your destruction, <br/>  for his wrath can flare up in a moment. <br/>   Blessed are all who take refuge in him. <br/></span>
