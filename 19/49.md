<div class="title"><h1>49</h1><i>For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. A psalm.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_49_1">  <sup>1</sup>Hear this, all you peoples; <br/>   listen, all who live in this world, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_49_2">  <sup>2</sup>both low and high, <br/>   rich and poor alike: <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_49_3">  <sup>3</sup>My mouth will speak words of wisdom; <br/>   the meditation of my heart will give you understanding. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_49_4">  <sup>4</sup>I will turn my ear to a proverb; <br/>   with the harp I will expound my riddle: <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_49_5">  <sup>5</sup>Why should I fear when evil days come, <br/>   when wicked deceivers surround me— <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_49_6">  <sup>6</sup>those who trust in their wealth <br/>   and boast of their great riches? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_49_7">  <sup>7</sup>No one can redeem the life of another <br/>   or give to God a ransom for them— <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_49_8">  <sup>8</sup>the ransom for a life is costly, <br/>   no payment is ever enough— <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_49_9">  <sup>9</sup>so that they should live on forever <br/>   and not see decay. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_49_10">  <sup>10</sup>For all can see that the wise die, <br/>   that the foolish and the senseless also perish, <br/>   leaving their wealth to others. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_49_11">  <sup>11</sup>Their tombs will remain their houses<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint and Syriac; Hebrew In their thoughts their houses will remain">⚓</a> forever, <br/>   their dwellings for endless generations, <br/>   though they had<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or generations, / for they have">⚓</a> named lands after themselves. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_49_12">  <sup>12</sup>People, despite their wealth, do not endure; <br/>   they are like the beasts that perish. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_49_13">  <sup>13</sup>This is the fate of those who trust in themselves, <br/>   and of their followers, who approve their sayings.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here and at the end of verse 15.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_49_14">  <sup>14</sup>They are like sheep and are destined to die; <br/>   death will be their shepherd <br/>   (but the upright will prevail over them in the morning). <br/>  Their forms will decay in the grave, <br/>   far from their princely mansions. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_49_15">  <sup>15</sup>But God will redeem me from the realm of the dead; <br/>   he will surely take me to himself. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_49_16">  <sup>16</sup>Do not be overawed when others grow rich, <br/>   when the splendor of their houses increases; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_49_17">  <sup>17</sup>for they will take nothing with them when they die, <br/>   their splendor will not descend with them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_49_18">  <sup>18</sup>Though while they live they count themselves blessed— <br/>   and people praise you when you prosper— <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_49_19">  <sup>19</sup>they will join those who have gone before them, <br/>   who will never again see the light of life. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_49_20">  <sup>20</sup>People who have wealth but lack understanding <br/>   are like the beasts that perish. <br/></span>
