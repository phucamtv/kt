<span class="verse thi_32_1">  <sup>1</sup>Blessed is the one <br/>   whose transgressions are forgiven, <br/>   whose sins are covered. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_32_2">  <sup>2</sup>Blessed is the one <br/>   whose sin the Lord does not count against them <br/>   and in whose spirit is no deceit. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_32_3">  <sup>3</sup>When I kept silent, <br/>   my bones wasted away <br/>   through my groaning all day long. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_32_4">  <sup>4</sup>For day and night <br/>   your hand was heavy on me; <br/>  my strength was sapped <br/>   as in the heat of summer.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here and at the end of verses 5 and 7.">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_32_5">  <sup>5</sup>Then I acknowledged my sin to you <br/>   and did not cover up my iniquity. <br/>  I said, “I will confess <br/>   my transgressions to the Lord.” <br/>  And you forgave <br/>   the guilt of my sin. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_32_6">  <sup>6</sup>Therefore let all the faithful pray to you <br/>   while you may be found; <br/>  surely the rising of the mighty waters <br/>   will not reach them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_32_7">  <sup>7</sup>You are my hiding place; <br/>   you will protect me from trouble <br/>   and surround me with songs of deliverance. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_32_8">  <sup>8</sup>I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; <br/>   I will counsel you with my loving eye on you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_32_9">  <sup>9</sup>Do not be like the horse or the mule, <br/>   which have no understanding <br/>  but must be controlled by bit and bridle <br/>   or they will not come to you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_32_10">  <sup>10</sup>Many are the woes of the wicked, <br/>   but the Lord’s unfailing love <br/>   surrounds the one who trusts in him. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_32_11">  <sup>11</sup>Rejoice in the Lord and be glad, you righteous; <br/>   sing, all you who are upright in heart! <br/></span>
