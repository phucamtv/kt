<div class="title"><h1>7</h1><i>A shiggaion<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Title: Probably a literary or musical term">⚓</a> of David, which he sang to the Lord concerning Cush, a Benjamite.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_7_1">  <sup>1</sup>Lord my God, I take refuge in you; <br/>   save and deliver me from all who pursue me, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_7_2">  <sup>2</sup>or they will tear me apart like a lion <br/>   and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_7_3">  <sup>3</sup>Lord my God, if I have done this <br/>   and there is guilt on my hands— <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_7_4">  <sup>4</sup>if I have repaid my ally with evil <br/>   or without cause have robbed my foe— <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_7_5">  <sup>5</sup>then let my enemy pursue and overtake me; <br/>   let him trample my life to the ground <br/>   and make me sleep in the dust.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here.">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_7_6">  <sup>6</sup>Arise, Lord, in your anger; <br/>   rise up against the rage of my enemies. <br/>   Awake, my God; decree justice. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_7_7">  <sup>7</sup>Let the assembled peoples gather around you, <br/>   while you sit enthroned over them on high. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_7_8">   <sup>8</sup>Let the Lord judge the peoples. <br/>  Vindicate me, Lord, according to my righteousness, <br/>   according to my integrity, O Most High. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_7_9">  <sup>9</sup>Bring to an end the violence of the wicked <br/>   and make the righteous secure— <br/>  you, the righteous God <br/>   who probes minds and hearts. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_7_10">  <sup>10</sup>My shield<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or sovereign">⚓</a> is God Most High, <br/>   who saves the upright in heart. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_7_11">  <sup>11</sup>God is a righteous judge, <br/>   a God who displays his wrath every day. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_7_12">  <sup>12</sup>If he does not relent, <br/>   he<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or If anyone does not repent, / God">⚓</a> will sharpen his sword; <br/>   he will bend and string his bow. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_7_13">  <sup>13</sup>He has prepared his deadly weapons; <br/>   he makes ready his flaming arrows. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_7_14">  <sup>14</sup>Whoever is pregnant with evil <br/>   conceives trouble and gives birth to disillusionment. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_7_15">  <sup>15</sup>Whoever digs a hole and scoops it out <br/>   falls into the pit they have made. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_7_16">  <sup>16</sup>The trouble they cause recoils on them; <br/>   their violence comes down on their own heads. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_7_17">  <sup>17</sup>I will give thanks to the Lord because of his righteousness; <br/>   I will sing the praises of the name of the Lord Most High. <br/></span>
