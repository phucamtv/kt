<span class="verse thi_123_1">  <sup>1</sup>I lift up my eyes to you, <br/>   to you who sit enthroned in heaven. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_123_2">  <sup>2</sup>As the eyes of slaves look to the hand of their master, <br/>   as the eyes of a female slave look to the hand of her mistress, <br/>  so our eyes look to the Lord our God, <br/>   till he shows us his mercy. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_123_3">  <sup>3</sup>Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy on us, <br/>   for we have endured no end of contempt. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_123_4">  <sup>4</sup>We have endured no end <br/>   of ridicule from the arrogant, <br/>   of contempt from the proud. <br/></span>
