<span class="verse thi_93_1">  <sup>1</sup>The Lord reigns, he is robed in majesty; <br/>   the Lord is robed in majesty and armed with strength; <br/>   indeed, the world is established, firm and secure. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_93_2">  <sup>2</sup>Your throne was established long ago; <br/>   you are from all eternity. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_93_3">  <sup>3</sup>The seas have lifted up, Lord, <br/>   the seas have lifted up their voice; <br/>   the seas have lifted up their pounding waves. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_93_4">  <sup>4</sup>Mightier than the thunder of the great waters, <br/>   mightier than the breakers of the sea— <br/>   the Lord on high is mighty. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_93_5">  <sup>5</sup>Your statutes, Lord, stand firm; <br/>   holiness adorns your house <br/>   for endless days. <br/></span>
