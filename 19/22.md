<span class="verse thi_22_1">  <sup>1</sup>My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? <br/>   Why are you so far from saving me, <br/>   so far from my cries of anguish? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_2">  <sup>2</sup>My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer, <br/>   by night, but I find no rest.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or night, and am not silent">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_3">  <sup>3</sup>Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One; <br/>   you are the one Israel praises.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Yet you are holy, / enthroned on the praises of Israel">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_4">  <sup>4</sup>In you our ancestors put their trust; <br/>   they trusted and you delivered them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_5">  <sup>5</sup>To you they cried out and were saved; <br/>   in you they trusted and were not put to shame. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_6">  <sup>6</sup>But I am a worm and not a man, <br/>   scorned by everyone, despised by the people. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_7">  <sup>7</sup>All who see me mock me; <br/>   they hurl insults, shaking their heads. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_8">  <sup>8</sup>“He trusts in the Lord,” they say, <br/>   “let the Lord rescue him. <br/>  Let him deliver him, <br/>   since he delights in him.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_9">  <sup>9</sup>Yet you brought me out of the womb; <br/>   you made me trust in you, even at my mother’s breast. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_10">  <sup>10</sup>From birth I was cast on you; <br/>   from my mother’s womb you have been my God. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_11">  <sup>11</sup>Do not be far from me, <br/>   for trouble is near <br/>   and there is no one to help. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_12">  <sup>12</sup>Many bulls surround me; <br/>   strong bulls of Bashan encircle me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_13">  <sup>13</sup>Roaring lions that tear their prey <br/>   open their mouths wide against me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_14">  <sup>14</sup>I am poured out like water, <br/>   and all my bones are out of joint. <br/>  My heart has turned to wax; <br/>   it has melted within me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_15">  <sup>15</sup>My mouth<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Probable reading of the original Hebrew text; Masoretic Text strength">⚓</a> is dried up like a potsherd, <br/>   and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; <br/>   you lay me in the dust of death. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_16">  <sup>16</sup>Dogs surround me, <br/>   a pack of villains encircles me; <br/>   they pierce<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dead Sea Scrolls and some manuscripts of the Masoretic Text, Septuagint and Syriac; most manuscripts of the Masoretic Text me, / like a lion">⚓</a> my hands and my feet. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_17">  <sup>17</sup>All my bones are on display; <br/>   people stare and gloat over me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_18">  <sup>18</sup>They divide my clothes among them <br/>   and cast lots for my garment. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_19">  <sup>19</sup>But you, Lord, do not be far from me. <br/>   You are my strength; come quickly to help me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_20">  <sup>20</sup>Deliver me from the sword, <br/>   my precious life from the power of the dogs. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_21">  <sup>21</sup>Rescue me from the mouth of the lions; <br/>   save me from the horns of the wild oxen. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_22">  <sup>22</sup>I will declare your name to my people; <br/>   in the assembly I will praise you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_23">  <sup>23</sup>You who fear the Lord, praise him! <br/>   All you descendants of Jacob, honor him! <br/>   Revere him, all you descendants of Israel! <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_24">  <sup>24</sup>For he has not despised or scorned <br/>   the suffering of the afflicted one; <br/>  he has not hidden his face from him <br/>   but has listened to his cry for help. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_25">  <sup>25</sup>From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly; <br/>   before those who fear you<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew him">⚓</a> I will fulfill my vows. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_26">  <sup>26</sup>The poor will eat and be satisfied; <br/>   those who seek the Lord will praise him— <br/>   may your hearts live forever! <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_27">  <sup>27</sup>All the ends of the earth <br/>   will remember and turn to the Lord, <br/>  and all the families of the nations <br/>   will bow down before him, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_28">  <sup>28</sup>for dominion belongs to the Lord<br/>   and he rules over the nations. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_29">  <sup>29</sup>All the rich of the earth will feast and worship; <br/>   all who go down to the dust will kneel before him— <br/>   those who cannot keep themselves alive. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_30">  <sup>30</sup>Posterity will serve him; <br/>   future generations will be told about the Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_22_31">  <sup>31</sup>They will proclaim his righteousness, <br/>   declaring to a people yet unborn: <br/>   He has done it! <br/></span>
