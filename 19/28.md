<span class="verse thi_28_1">  <sup>1</sup>To you, Lord, I call; <br/>   you are my Rock, <br/>   do not turn a deaf ear to me. <br/>  For if you remain silent, <br/>   I will be like those who go down to the pit. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_28_2">  <sup>2</sup>Hear my cry for mercy <br/>   as I call to you for help, <br/>  as I lift up my hands <br/>   toward your Most Holy Place. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_28_3">  <sup>3</sup>Do not drag me away with the wicked, <br/>   with those who do evil, <br/>  who speak cordially with their neighbors <br/>   but harbor malice in their hearts. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_28_4">  <sup>4</sup>Repay them for their deeds <br/>   and for their evil work; <br/>  repay them for what their hands have done <br/>   and bring back on them what they deserve. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_28_5">  <sup>5</sup>Because they have no regard for the deeds of the Lord<br/>   and what his hands have done, <br/>  he will tear them down <br/>   and never build them up again. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_28_6">  <sup>6</sup>Praise be to the Lord, <br/>   for he has heard my cry for mercy. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_28_7">  <sup>7</sup>The Lord is my strength and my shield; <br/>   my heart trusts in him, and he helps me. <br/>  My heart leaps for joy, <br/>   and with my song I praise him. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_28_8">  <sup>8</sup>The Lord is the strength of his people, <br/>   a fortress of salvation for his anointed one. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_28_9">  <sup>9</sup>Save your people and bless your inheritance; <br/>   be their shepherd and carry them forever. <br/></span>
