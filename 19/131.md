<span class="verse thi_131_1">  <sup>1</sup>My heart is not proud, Lord, <br/>   my eyes are not haughty; <br/>  I do not concern myself with great matters <br/>   or things too wonderful for me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_131_2">  <sup>2</sup>But I have calmed and quieted myself, <br/>   I am like a weaned child with its mother; <br/>   like a weaned child I am content. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_131_3">  <sup>3</sup>Israel, put your hope in the Lord<br/>   both now and forevermore. <br/></span>
