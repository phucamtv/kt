<span class="verse thi_18_1">  <sup>1</sup>I love you, Lord, my strength. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_2">  <sup>2</sup>The Lord is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; <br/>   my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, <br/>   my shield<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or sovereign">⚓</a> and the horn<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="here symbolizes strength.">⚓</a> of my salvation, my stronghold. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_3">  <sup>3</sup>I called to the Lord, who is worthy of praise, <br/>   and I have been saved from my enemies. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_4">  <sup>4</sup>The cords of death entangled me; <br/>   the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_5">  <sup>5</sup>The cords of the grave coiled around me; <br/>   the snares of death confronted me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_6">  <sup>6</sup>In my distress I called to the Lord; <br/>   I cried to my God for help. <br/>  From his temple he heard my voice; <br/>   my cry came before him, into his ears. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_7">  <sup>7</sup>The earth trembled and quaked, <br/>   and the foundations of the mountains shook; <br/>   they trembled because he was angry. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_8">  <sup>8</sup>Smoke rose from his nostrils; <br/>   consuming fire came from his mouth, <br/>   burning coals blazed out of it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_9">  <sup>9</sup>He parted the heavens and came down; <br/>   dark clouds were under his feet. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_10">  <sup>10</sup>He mounted the cherubim and flew; <br/>   he soared on the wings of the wind. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_11">  <sup>11</sup>He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him— <br/>   the dark rain clouds of the sky. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_12">  <sup>12</sup>Out of the brightness of his presence clouds advanced, <br/>   with hailstones and bolts of lightning. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_13">  <sup>13</sup>The Lord thundered from heaven; <br/>   the voice of the Most High resounded.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some Hebrew manuscripts and Septuagint (see also 2 Samuel 22:14); most Hebrew manuscripts resounded, / amid hailstones and bolts of lightning">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_14">  <sup>14</sup>He shot his arrows and scattered the enemy, <br/>   with great bolts of lightning he routed them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_15">  <sup>15</sup>The valleys of the sea were exposed <br/>   and the foundations of the earth laid bare <br/>  at your rebuke, Lord, <br/>   at the blast of breath from your nostrils. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_16">  <sup>16</sup>He reached down from on high and took hold of me; <br/>   he drew me out of deep waters. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_17">  <sup>17</sup>He rescued me from my powerful enemy, <br/>   from my foes, who were too strong for me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_18">  <sup>18</sup>They confronted me in the day of my disaster, <br/>   but the Lord was my support. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_19">  <sup>19</sup>He brought me out into a spacious place; <br/>   he rescued me because he delighted in me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_20">  <sup>20</sup>The Lord has dealt with me according to my righteousness; <br/>   according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_21">  <sup>21</sup>For I have kept the ways of the Lord; <br/>   I am not guilty of turning from my God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_22">  <sup>22</sup>All his laws are before me; <br/>   I have not turned away from his decrees. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_23">  <sup>23</sup>I have been blameless before him <br/>   and have kept myself from sin. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_24">  <sup>24</sup>The Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness, <br/>   according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_25">  <sup>25</sup>To the faithful you show yourself faithful, <br/>   to the blameless you show yourself blameless, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_26">  <sup>26</sup>to the pure you show yourself pure, <br/>   but to the devious you show yourself shrewd. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_27">  <sup>27</sup>You save the humble <br/>   but bring low those whose eyes are haughty. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_28">  <sup>28</sup>You, Lord, keep my lamp burning; <br/>   my God turns my darkness into light. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_29">  <sup>29</sup>With your help I can advance against a troop<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or can run through a barricade">⚓</a> ; <br/>   with my God I can scale a wall. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_30">  <sup>30</sup>As for God, his way is perfect: <br/>   The Lord’s word is flawless; <br/>   he shields all who take refuge in him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_31">  <sup>31</sup>For who is God besides the Lord? <br/>   And who is the Rock except our God? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_32">  <sup>32</sup>It is God who arms me with strength <br/>   and keeps my way secure. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_33">  <sup>33</sup>He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; <br/>   he causes me to stand on the heights. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_34">  <sup>34</sup>He trains my hands for battle; <br/>   my arms can bend a bow of bronze. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_35">  <sup>35</sup>You make your saving help my shield, <br/>   and your right hand sustains me; <br/>   your help has made me great. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_36">  <sup>36</sup>You provide a broad path for my feet, <br/>   so that my ankles do not give way. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_37">  <sup>37</sup>I pursued my enemies and overtook them; <br/>   I did not turn back till they were destroyed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_38">  <sup>38</sup>I crushed them so that they could not rise; <br/>   they fell beneath my feet. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_39">  <sup>39</sup>You armed me with strength for battle; <br/>   you humbled my adversaries before me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_40">  <sup>40</sup>You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, <br/>   and I destroyed my foes. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_41">  <sup>41</sup>They cried for help, but there was no one to save them— <br/>   to the Lord, but he did not answer. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_42">  <sup>42</sup>I beat them as fine as windblown dust; <br/>   I trampled them<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Many Hebrew manuscripts, Septuagint, Syriac and Targum (see also 2 Samuel 22:43); Masoretic Text I poured them out">⚓</a> like mud in the streets. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_43">  <sup>43</sup>You have delivered me from the attacks of the people; <br/>   you have made me the head of nations. <br/>  People I did not know now serve me, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_44">   <sup>44</sup>foreigners cower before me; <br/>   as soon as they hear of me, they obey me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_45">  <sup>45</sup>They all lose heart; <br/>   they come trembling from their strongholds. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_46">  <sup>46</sup>The Lord lives! Praise be to my Rock! <br/>   Exalted be God my Savior! <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_47">  <sup>47</sup>He is the God who avenges me, <br/>   who subdues nations under me, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_48">   <sup>48</sup>who saves me from my enemies. <br/>  You exalted me above my foes; <br/>   from a violent man you rescued me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_49">  <sup>49</sup>Therefore I will praise you, Lord, among the nations; <br/>   I will sing the praises of your name. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_18_50">  <sup>50</sup>He gives his king great victories; <br/>   he shows unfailing love to his anointed, <br/>   to David and to his descendants forever. <br/></span>
