<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><i>For the director of music. Of David.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_11_1">  <sup>1</sup>In the Lord I take refuge. <br/>   How then can you say to me: <br/>   “Flee like a bird to your mountain. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_11_2">  <sup>2</sup>For look, the wicked bend their bows; <br/>   they set their arrows against the strings <br/>  to shoot from the shadows <br/>   at the upright in heart. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_11_3">  <sup>3</sup>When the foundations are being destroyed, <br/>   what can the righteous do?” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_11_4">  <sup>4</sup>The Lord is in his holy temple; <br/>   the Lord is on his heavenly throne. <br/>  He observes everyone on earth; <br/>   his eyes examine them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_11_5">  <sup>5</sup>The Lord examines the righteous, <br/>   but the wicked, those who love violence, <br/>   he hates with a passion. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_11_6">  <sup>6</sup>On the wicked he will rain <br/>   fiery coals and burning sulfur; <br/>   a scorching wind will be their lot. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_11_7">  <sup>7</sup>For the Lord is righteous, <br/>   he loves justice; <br/>   the upright will see his face. <br/></span>
