<span class="verse thi_50_1">  <sup>1</sup>The Mighty One, God, the Lord, <br/>   speaks and summons the earth <br/>   from the rising of the sun to where it sets. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_2">  <sup>2</sup>From Zion, perfect in beauty, <br/>   God shines forth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_3">  <sup>3</sup>Our God comes <br/>   and will not be silent; <br/>  a fire devours before him, <br/>   and around him a tempest rages. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_4">  <sup>4</sup>He summons the heavens above, <br/>   and the earth, that he may judge his people: <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_5">  <sup>5</sup>“Gather to me this consecrated people, <br/>   who made a covenant with me by sacrifice.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_6">  <sup>6</sup>And the heavens proclaim his righteousness, <br/>   for he is a God of justice.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="With a different word division of the Hebrew; Masoretic Text for God himself is judge">⚓</a><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here.">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_7">  <sup>7</sup>“Listen, my people, and I will speak; <br/>   I will testify against you, Israel: <br/>   I am God, your God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_8">  <sup>8</sup>I bring no charges against you concerning your sacrifices <br/>   or concerning your burnt offerings, which are ever before me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_9">  <sup>9</sup>I have no need of a bull from your stall <br/>   or of goats from your pens, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_10">  <sup>10</sup>for every animal of the forest is mine, <br/>   and the cattle on a thousand hills. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_11">  <sup>11</sup>I know every bird in the mountains, <br/>   and the insects in the fields are mine. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_12">  <sup>12</sup>If I were hungry I would not tell you, <br/>   for the world is mine, and all that is in it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_13">  <sup>13</sup>Do I eat the flesh of bulls <br/>   or drink the blood of goats? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_14">  <sup>14</sup>“Sacrifice thank offerings to God, <br/>   fulfill your vows to the Most High, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_15">  <sup>15</sup>and call on me in the day of trouble; <br/>   I will deliver you, and you will honor me.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_16"> <sup>16</sup>But to the wicked person, God says: <br/>  “What right have you to recite my laws <br/>   or take my covenant on your lips? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_17">  <sup>17</sup>You hate my instruction <br/>   and cast my words behind you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_18">  <sup>18</sup>When you see a thief, you join with him; <br/>   you throw in your lot with adulterers. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_19">  <sup>19</sup>You use your mouth for evil <br/>   and harness your tongue to deceit. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_20">  <sup>20</sup>You sit and testify against your brother <br/>   and slander your own mother’s son. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_21">  <sup>21</sup>When you did these things and I kept silent, <br/>   you thought I was exactly<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or thought the ‘I am’ was">⚓</a> like you. <br/>  But I now arraign you <br/>   and set my accusations before you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_22">  <sup>22</sup>“Consider this, you who forget God, <br/>   or I will tear you to pieces, with no one to rescue you: <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_50_23">  <sup>23</sup>Those who sacrifice thank offerings honor me, <br/>   and to the blameless<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Probable reading of the original Hebrew text; the meaning of the Masoretic Text for this phrase is uncertain.">⚓</a> I will show my salvation.” <br/></span>
