<div class="title"><h1>38</h1><i>A psalm of David. A petition.</i></div>
<span class="verse thi_38_1">  <sup>1</sup>Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger <br/>   or discipline me in your wrath. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_2">  <sup>2</sup>Your arrows have pierced me, <br/>   and your hand has come down on me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_3">  <sup>3</sup>Because of your wrath there is no health in my body; <br/>   there is no soundness in my bones because of my sin. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_4">  <sup>4</sup>My guilt has overwhelmed me <br/>   like a burden too heavy to bear. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_5">  <sup>5</sup>My wounds fester and are loathsome <br/>   because of my sinful folly. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_6">  <sup>6</sup>I am bowed down and brought very low; <br/>   all day long I go about mourning. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_7">  <sup>7</sup>My back is filled with searing pain; <br/>   there is no health in my body. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_8">  <sup>8</sup>I am feeble and utterly crushed; <br/>   I groan in anguish of heart. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_9">  <sup>9</sup>All my longings lie open before you, Lord; <br/>   my sighing is not hidden from you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_10">  <sup>10</sup>My heart pounds, my strength fails me; <br/>   even the light has gone from my eyes. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_11">  <sup>11</sup>My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds; <br/>   my neighbors stay far away. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_12">  <sup>12</sup>Those who want to kill me set their traps, <br/>   those who would harm me talk of my ruin; <br/>   all day long they scheme and lie. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_13">  <sup>13</sup>I am like the deaf, who cannot hear, <br/>   like the mute, who cannot speak; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_14">  <sup>14</sup>I have become like one who does not hear, <br/>   whose mouth can offer no reply. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_15">  <sup>15</sup>Lord, I wait for you; <br/>   you will answer, Lord my God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_16">  <sup>16</sup>For I said, “Do not let them gloat <br/>   or exalt themselves over me when my feet slip.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_17">  <sup>17</sup>For I am about to fall, <br/>   and my pain is ever with me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_18">  <sup>18</sup>I confess my iniquity; <br/>   I am troubled by my sin. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_19">  <sup>19</sup>Many have become my enemies without cause<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="One Dead Sea Scrolls manuscript; Masoretic Text my vigorous enemies">⚓</a> ; <br/>   those who hate me without reason are numerous. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_20">  <sup>20</sup>Those who repay my good with evil <br/>   lodge accusations against me, <br/>   though I seek only to do what is good. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_21">  <sup>21</sup>Lord, do not forsake me; <br/>   do not be far from me, my God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_38_22">  <sup>22</sup>Come quickly to help me, <br/>   my Lord and my Savior. <br/></span>
