<span class="verse thi_107_2">  <sup>2</sup>Let the redeemed of the Lord tell their story— <br/>   those he redeemed from the hand of the foe, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_3">  <sup>3</sup>those he gathered from the lands, <br/>   from east and west, from north and south.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew north and the sea">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_4">  <sup>4</sup>Some wandered in desert wastelands, <br/>   finding no way to a city where they could settle. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_5">  <sup>5</sup>They were hungry and thirsty, <br/>   and their lives ebbed away. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_6">  <sup>6</sup>Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, <br/>   and he delivered them from their distress. <br/></span>

<span class="verse thi_107_10">  <sup>10</sup>Some sat in darkness, in utter darkness, <br/>   prisoners suffering in iron chains, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_11">  <sup>11</sup>because they rebelled against God’s commands <br/>   and despised the plans of the Most High. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_12">  <sup>12</sup>So he subjected them to bitter labor; <br/>   they stumbled, and there was no one to help. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_13">  <sup>13</sup>Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, <br/>   and he saved them from their distress. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_14">  <sup>14</sup>He brought them out of darkness, the utter darkness, <br/>   and broke away their chains. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_15">  <sup>15</sup>Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love <br/>   and his wonderful deeds for mankind, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_16">  <sup>16</sup>for he breaks down gates of bronze <br/>   and cuts through bars of iron. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_17">  <sup>17</sup>Some became fools through their rebellious ways <br/>   and suffered affliction because of their iniquities. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_18">  <sup>18</sup>They loathed all food <br/>   and drew near the gates of death. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_19">  <sup>19</sup>Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, <br/>   and he saved them from their distress. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_20">  <sup>20</sup>He sent out his word and healed them; <br/>   he rescued them from the grave. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_21">  <sup>21</sup>Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love <br/>   and his wonderful deeds for mankind. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_22">  <sup>22</sup>Let them sacrifice thank offerings <br/>   and tell of his works with songs of joy. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_23">  <sup>23</sup>Some went out on the sea in ships; <br/>   they were merchants on the mighty waters. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_24">  <sup>24</sup>They saw the works of the Lord, <br/>   his wonderful deeds in the deep. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_25">  <sup>25</sup>For he spoke and stirred up a tempest <br/>   that lifted high the waves. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_26">  <sup>26</sup>They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths; <br/>   in their peril their courage melted away. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_27">  <sup>27</sup>They reeled and staggered like drunkards; <br/>   they were at their wits’ end. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_28">  <sup>28</sup>Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, <br/>   and he brought them out of their distress. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_29">  <sup>29</sup>He stilled the storm to a whisper; <br/>   the waves of the sea<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dead Sea Scrolls; Masoretic Text / their waves">⚓</a> were hushed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_30">  <sup>30</sup>They were glad when it grew calm, <br/>   and he guided them to their desired haven. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_31">  <sup>31</sup>Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love <br/>   and his wonderful deeds for mankind. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_32">  <sup>32</sup>Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people <br/>   and praise him in the council of the elders. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_33">  <sup>33</sup>He turned rivers into a desert, <br/>   flowing springs into thirsty ground, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_34">  <sup>34</sup>and fruitful land into a salt waste, <br/>   because of the wickedness of those who lived there. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_35">  <sup>35</sup>He turned the desert into pools of water <br/>   and the parched ground into flowing springs; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_36">  <sup>36</sup>there he brought the hungry to live, <br/>   and they founded a city where they could settle. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_37">  <sup>37</sup>They sowed fields and planted vineyards <br/>   that yielded a fruitful harvest; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_38">  <sup>38</sup>he blessed them, and their numbers greatly increased, <br/>   and he did not let their herds diminish. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_39">  <sup>39</sup>Then their numbers decreased, and they were humbled <br/>   by oppression, calamity and sorrow; <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_40">  <sup>40</sup>he who pours contempt on nobles <br/>   made them wander in a trackless waste. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_41">  <sup>41</sup>But he lifted the needy out of their affliction <br/>   and increased their families like flocks. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_42">  <sup>42</sup>The upright see and rejoice, <br/>   but all the wicked shut their mouths. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_107_43">  <sup>43</sup>Let the one who is wise heed these things <br/>   and ponder the loving deeds of the Lord. <br/></span>
