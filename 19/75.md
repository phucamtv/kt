<span class="verse thi_75_1">  <sup>1</sup>We praise you, God, <br/>   we praise you, for your Name is near; <br/>   people tell of your wonderful deeds. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_75_2">  <sup>2</sup>You say, “I choose the appointed time; <br/>   it is I who judge with equity. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_75_3">  <sup>3</sup>When the earth and all its people quake, <br/>   it is I who hold its pillars firm.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_75_4">  <sup>4</sup>To the arrogant I say, ‘Boast no more,’ <br/>   and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horns.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="here symbolize strength; also in verses 5 and 10.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_75_5">  <sup>5</sup>Do not lift your horns against heaven; <br/>   do not speak so defiantly.’ ” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_75_6">  <sup>6</sup>No one from the east or the west <br/>   or from the desert can exalt themselves. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_75_7">  <sup>7</sup>It is God who judges: <br/>   He brings one down, he exalts another. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_75_8">  <sup>8</sup>In the hand of the Lord is a cup <br/>   full of foaming wine mixed with spices; <br/>  he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth <br/>   drink it down to its very dregs. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_75_9">  <sup>9</sup>As for me, I will declare this forever; <br/>   I will sing praise to the God of Jacob, <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_75_10">  <sup>10</sup>who says, “I will cut off the horns of all the wicked, <br/>   but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.” <br/></span>
