<span class="verse thi_130_2">   <sup>2</sup>Lord, hear my voice. <br/>  Let your ears be attentive <br/>   to my cry for mercy. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_130_3">  <sup>3</sup>If you, Lord, kept a record of sins, <br/>   Lord, who could stand? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_130_4">  <sup>4</sup>But with you there is forgiveness, <br/>   so that we can, with reverence, serve you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_130_5">  <sup>5</sup>I wait for the Lord, my whole being waits, <br/>   and in his word I put my hope. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_130_6">  <sup>6</sup>I wait for the Lord <br/>   more than watchmen wait for the morning, <br/>   more than watchmen wait for the morning. <br/><br/></span>
