<span class="verse thi_85_2">  <sup>2</sup>You forgave the iniquity of your people <br/>   and covered all their sins.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_85_3">  <sup>3</sup>You set aside all your wrath <br/>   and turned from your fierce anger. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_85_4">  <sup>4</sup>Restore us again, God our Savior, <br/>   and put away your displeasure toward us. <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_85_5">  <sup>5</sup>Will you be angry with us forever? <br/>   Will you prolong your anger through all generations? <br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_85_6">  <sup>6</sup>Will you not revive us again, <br/>   that your people may rejoice in you? <br/></span>
