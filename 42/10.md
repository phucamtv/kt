<div class="title"><h1>10</h1><h3>Jesus Sends Out the Seventy-Two </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_10_1"> <sup>1</sup>After this the Lord appointed seventy-two<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts seventy ; also in verse 17">⚓</a> others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go. </span>
<span class="verse lu_10_2"><sup>2</sup>He told them, <font color="red">“The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_5"> <sup>5</sup><font color="red">“When you enter a house, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_8"> <sup>8</sup><font color="red">“When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say,</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">‘Even the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God has come near.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_13"> <sup>13</sup><font color="red">“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, the realm of the dead">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_16"> <sup>16</sup><font color="red">“Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; but whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_17"> <sup>17</sup>The seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_18"> <sup>18</sup>He replied, <font color="red">“I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_21"> <sup>21</sup>At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, <font color="red">“I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_22"> <sup>22</sup><font color="red">“All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, <font color="red">“Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Good Samaritan </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_10_25"> <sup>25</sup>On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_26"> <sup>26</sup><font color="red">“What is written in the Law?”</font> he replied. <font color="red">“How do you read it?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_27"> <sup>27</sup>He answered, “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:5">⚓</a> ; and, ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:18">⚓</a> ” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_28"> <sup>28</sup><font color="red">“You have answered correctly,”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="red">“Do this and you will live.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_29"> <sup>29</sup>But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_30"> <sup>30</sup>In reply Jesus said: <font color="red">“A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_33"><sup>33</sup><font color="red">But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_34"><sup>34</sup><font color="red">He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">The next day he took out two denarii</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="A denarius was the usual daily wage of a day laborer (see Matt. 20:2).">⚓</a><font color="red">and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look after him,’ he said, ‘and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_36"> <sup>36</sup><font color="red">“Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_37"> <sup>37</sup>The expert in the law replied, “The one who had mercy on him.” <br/> Jesus told him, <font color="red">“Go and do likewise.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>At the Home of Martha and Mary </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_10_38"> <sup>38</sup>As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_10_39"><sup>39</sup>She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to what he said. </span>
<span class="verse lu_10_40"><sup>40</sup>But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_41"> <sup>41</sup><font color="red">“Martha, Martha,”</font> the Lord answered, <font color="red">“you are worried and upset about many things,</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_42"><sup>42</sup><font color="red">but few things are needed—or indeed only one.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts but only one thing is needed">⚓</a><font color="red">Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.”</font><br/></span>
