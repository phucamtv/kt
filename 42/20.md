<div class="title"><h1>20</h1><h3>The Authority of Jesus Questioned </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_20_1"> <sup>1</sup>One day as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with the elders, came up to him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_2"><sup>2</sup>“Tell us by what authority you are doing these things,” they said. “Who gave you this authority?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_3"> <sup>3</sup>He replied, <font color="red">“I will also ask you a question. Tell me:</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or of human origin?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_5"> <sup>5</sup>They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’ </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_6"><sup>6</sup>But if we say, ‘Of human origin,’ all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_7"> <sup>7</sup>So they answered, “We don’t know where it was from.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_8"> <sup>8</sup>Jesus said, <font color="red">“Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Tenants </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_20_9"> <sup>9</sup>He went on to tell the people this parable: <font color="red">“A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_13"> <sup>13</sup><font color="red">“Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_14"> <sup>14</sup><font color="red">“But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. ‘This is the heir,’ they said. ‘Let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. </font><br/> <font color="red">“What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.”</font><br/> When the people heard this, they said, “God forbid!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_17"> <sup>17</sup>Jesus looked directly at them and asked, <font color="red">“Then what is the meaning of that which is written: </font><br/>  <font color="red">“ ‘The stone the builders rejected </font><br/>   <font color="red">has become the cornerstone’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 20:17 Psalm 118:22 ">⚓</a><font color="red">?</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_19"> <sup>19</sup>The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Paying Taxes to Caesar </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_20_20"> <sup>20</sup>Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be sincere. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said, so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor. </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_21"><sup>21</sup>So the spies questioned him: “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_22"><sup>22</sup>Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_23"> <sup>23</sup>He saw through their duplicity and said to them, </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">“Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?”</font><br/> “Caesar’s,” they replied. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_25"> <sup>25</sup>He said to them, <font color="red">“Then give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_26"> <sup>26</sup>They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Resurrection and Marriage </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_20_27"> <sup>27</sup>Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question. </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_28"><sup>28</sup>“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_29"><sup>29</sup>Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless. </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_30"><sup>30</sup>The second </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_31"><sup>31</sup>and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children. </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_32"><sup>32</sup>Finally, the woman died too. </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_33"><sup>33</sup>Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_34"> <sup>34</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage,</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_36"><sup>36</sup><font color="red">and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God’s children, since they are children of the resurrection.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_37"><sup>37</sup><font color="red">But in the account of the burning bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Exodus 3:6">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_38"><sup>38</sup><font color="red">He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_39"> <sup>39</sup>Some of the teachers of the law responded, “Well said, teacher!” </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_40"><sup>40</sup>And no one dared to ask him any more questions. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Whose Son Is the Messiah? </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_20_41"> <sup>41</sup>Then Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Why is it said that the Messiah is the son of David?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_42"><sup>42</sup><font color="red">David himself declares in the Book of Psalms: </font><br/>  <font color="red">“ ‘The Lord said to my Lord: </font><br/>   <font color="red">“Sit at my right hand</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_43">  <sup>43</sup><font color="red">until I make your enemies </font><br/>   <font color="red">a footstool for your feet.” ’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 20:43 Psalm 110:1 ">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_44"><sup>44</sup><font color="red">David calls him ‘Lord.’ How then can he be his son?”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Warning Against the Teachers of the Law </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_20_45"> <sup>45</sup>While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples, </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_46"><sup>46</sup><font color="red">“Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_47"><sup>47</sup><font color="red">They devour widows’ houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely.”</font><br/></span>
