<div class="title"><h1>18</h1><h3>The Parable of the Persistent Widow </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_18_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up. </span>
<span class="verse lu_18_2"><sup>2</sup>He said: <font color="red">“In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_4"> <sup>4</sup><font color="red">“For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, ‘Even though I don’t fear God or care what people think,</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won’t eventually come and attack me!’ ”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_6"> <sup>6</sup>And the Lord said, <font color="red">“Listen to what the unjust judge says.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_18_9"> <sup>9</sup>To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: </span>
<span class="verse lu_18_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">“Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_13"> <sup>13</sup><font color="red">“But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_14"> <sup>14</sup><font color="red">“I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Little Children and Jesus </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_18_15"> <sup>15</sup>People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. </span>
<span class="verse lu_18_16"><sup>16</sup>But Jesus called the children to him and said, <font color="red">“Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Rich and the Kingdom of God </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_18_18"> <sup>18</sup>A certain ruler asked him, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_19"> <sup>19</sup><font color="red">“Why do you call me good?”</font> Jesus answered. <font color="red">“No one is good—except God alone.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">You know the commandments: ‘You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Exodus 20:12-16; Deut. 5:16-20">⚓</a><font color="red">”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_21"> <sup>21</sup>“All these I have kept since I was a boy,” he said. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_22"> <sup>22</sup>When Jesus heard this, he said to him, <font color="red">“You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_23"> <sup>23</sup>When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very wealthy. </span>
<span class="verse lu_18_24"><sup>24</sup>Jesus looked at him and said, <font color="red">“How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_26"> <sup>26</sup>Those who heard this asked, “Who then can be saved?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_27"> <sup>27</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“What is impossible with man is possible with God.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_28"> <sup>28</sup>Peter said to him, “We have left all we had to follow you!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_29"> <sup>29</sup><font color="red">“Truly I tell you,”</font> Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to come eternal life.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Predicts His Death a Third Time </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_18_31"> <sup>31</sup>Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, <font color="red">“We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">He will be delivered over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him and spit on him;</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_33"><sup>33</sup><font color="red">they will flog him and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_34"> <sup>34</sup>The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Blind Beggar Receives His Sight </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_18_35"> <sup>35</sup>As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. </span>
<span class="verse lu_18_36"><sup>36</sup>When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening. </span>
<span class="verse lu_18_37"><sup>37</sup>They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_38"> <sup>38</sup>He called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_39"> <sup>39</sup>Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_40"> <sup>40</sup>Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him, </span>
<span class="verse lu_18_41"><sup>41</sup><font color="red">“What do you want me to do for you?”</font><br/> “Lord, I want to see,” he replied. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_42"> <sup>42</sup>Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_43"><sup>43</sup>Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God. <br/></span>
