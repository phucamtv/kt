<div class="title"><h1>17</h1><h3>Sin, Faith, Duty </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_17_1"> <sup>1</sup>Jesus said to his disciples: <font color="red">“Things that cause people to stumble are bound to come, but woe to anyone through whom they come.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_2"><sup>2</sup><font color="red">It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">So watch yourselves. </font><br/> <font color="red">“If your brother or sister</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 17:3 The Greek word for  brother or sister ( adelphos ) refers here to a fellow disciple, whether man or woman. ">⚓</a><font color="red">sins against you, rebuke them; and if they repent, forgive them.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and seven times come back to you saying ‘I repent,’ you must forgive them.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_5"> <sup>5</sup>The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_6"> <sup>6</sup>He replied, <font color="red">“If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it will obey you.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_7"> <sup>7</sup><font color="red">“Suppose one of you has a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Will he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, ‘Come along now and sit down to eat’?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">Won’t he rather say, ‘Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink’?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">Will he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.’ ”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Heals Ten Men With Leprosy </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_17_11"> <sup>11</sup>Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee. </span>
<span class="verse lu_17_12"><sup>12</sup>As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek word traditionally translated leprosy was used for various diseases affecting the skin.">⚓</a> met him. They stood at a distance </span>
<span class="verse lu_17_13"><sup>13</sup>and called out in a loud voice, “Jesus, Master, have pity on us!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_14"> <sup>14</sup>When he saw them, he said, <font color="red">“Go, show yourselves to the priests.”</font> And as they went, they were cleansed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_15"> <sup>15</sup>One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. </span>
<span class="verse lu_17_16"><sup>16</sup>He threw himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked him—and he was a Samaritan. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_17"> <sup>17</sup>Jesus asked, <font color="red">“Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_19"><sup>19</sup>Then he said to him, <font color="red">“Rise and go; your faith has made you well.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Coming of the Kingdom of God </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_17_20"> <sup>20</sup>Once, on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, <font color="red">“The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed,</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">nor will people say, ‘Here it is,’ or ‘There it is,’ because the kingdom of God is in your midst.”</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or is within you">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then he said to his disciples, <font color="red">“The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">People will tell you, ‘There he is!’ or ‘Here he is!’ Do not go running off after them.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">For the Son of Man in his day</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts do not have in his day.">⚓</a><font color="red">will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_26"> <sup>26</sup><font color="red">“Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_28"> <sup>28</sup><font color="red">“It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_30"> <sup>30</sup><font color="red">“It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">On that day no one who is on the housetop, with possessions inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">Remember Lot’s wife!</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_33"><sup>33</sup><font color="red">Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life will preserve it.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_34"><sup>34</sup><font color="red">I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_36"><sup>[36]</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts include here words similar to Matt. 24:40.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_37"> <sup>37</sup>“Where, Lord?” they asked. <br/> He replied, <font color="red">“Where there is a dead body, there the vultures will gather.”</font><br/></span>
