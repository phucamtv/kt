<div class="title"><h1>15</h1><h3>The Parable of the Lost Sheep </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_15_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse lu_15_2"><sup>2</sup>But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then Jesus told them this parable: </span>
<span class="verse lu_15_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">“Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Lost Coin </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_15_8"> <sup>8</sup><font color="red">“Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 15:8 Greek  ten drachmas, each worth about a day’s wages ">⚓</a><font color="red">and loses one. Doesn’t she light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Lost Son </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_15_11"> <sup>11</sup>Jesus continued: <font color="red">“There was a man who had two sons.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’ So he divided his property between them.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_13"> <sup>13</sup><font color="red">“Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_17"> <sup>17</sup><font color="red">“When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">So he got up and went to his father. </font><br/> <font color="red">“But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_21"> <sup>21</sup><font color="red">“The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_22"> <sup>22</sup><font color="red">“But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_25"> <sup>25</sup><font color="red">“Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_28"> <sup>28</sup><font color="red">“The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years I’ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_31"> <sup>31</sup><font color="red">“ ‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ ”</font><br/></span>
