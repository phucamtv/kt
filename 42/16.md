<div class="title"><h1>16</h1><h3>The Parable of the Shrewd Manager </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_16_1"> <sup>1</sup>Jesus told his disciples: <font color="red">“There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_2"><sup>2</sup><font color="red">So he called him in and asked him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_3"> <sup>3</sup><font color="red">“The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I’m not strong enough to dig, and I’m ashamed to beg—</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">I know what I’ll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_5"> <sup>5</sup><font color="red">“So he called in each one of his master’s debtors. He asked the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_6"> <sup>6</sup><font color="red">“ ‘Nine hundred gallons</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 16:6 Or about 3,000 liters ">⚓</a><font color="red">of olive oil,’ he replied. </font><br/> <font color="red">“The manager told him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred and fifty.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_7"> <sup>7</sup><font color="red">“Then he asked the second, ‘And how much do you owe?’ </font><br/> <font color="red">“ ‘A thousand bushels</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 16:7 Or about 30 tons ">⚓</a><font color="red">of wheat,’ he replied. </font><br/> <font color="red">“He told him, ‘Take your bill and make it eight hundred.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_8"> <sup>8</sup><font color="red">“The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_10"> <sup>10</sup><font color="red">“Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else’s property, who will give you property of your own?</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_13"> <sup>13</sup><font color="red">“No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_14"> <sup>14</sup>The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse lu_16_15"><sup>15</sup>He said to them, <font color="red">“You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God’s sight.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Additional Teachings </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_16_16"> <sup>16</sup><font color="red">“The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing their way into it.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_18"> <sup>18</sup><font color="red">“Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Rich Man and Lazarus </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_16_19"> <sup>19</sup><font color="red">“There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">and longing to eat what fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_22"> <sup>22</sup><font color="red">“The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">So he called to him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_25"> <sup>25</sup><font color="red">“But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_27"> <sup>27</sup><font color="red">“He answered, ‘Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family,</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_28"><sup>28</sup><font color="red">for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_29"> <sup>29</sup><font color="red">“Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_30"> <sup>30</sup><font color="red">“ ‘No, father Abraham,’ he said, ‘but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_31"> <sup>31</sup><font color="red">“He said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’ ”</font><br/></span>
