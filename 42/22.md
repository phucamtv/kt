<div class="title"><h1>22</h1><h3>Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_22_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching, </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_2"><sup>2</sup>and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people. </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_3"><sup>3</sup>Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve. </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_4"><sup>4</sup>And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_5"><sup>5</sup>They were delighted and agreed to give him money. </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_6"><sup>6</sup>He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Last Supper </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_22_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_8"><sup>8</sup>Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, <font color="red">“Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_9"> <sup>9</sup>“Where do you want us to prepare for it?” they asked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_10"> <sup>10</sup>He replied, <font color="red">“As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters,</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">He will show you a large room upstairs, all furnished. Make preparations there.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_13"> <sup>13</sup>They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_14"> <sup>14</sup>When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_15"><sup>15</sup>And he said to them, <font color="red">“I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_17"> <sup>17</sup>After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, <font color="red">“Take this and divide it among you.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_19"> <sup>19</sup>And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, <font color="red">“This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_20"> <sup>20</sup>In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, <font color="red">“This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts do not have given for you … poured out for you.">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed. But woe to that man who betrays him!”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_23"><sup>23</sup>They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_24"> <sup>24</sup>A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest. </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_25"><sup>25</sup>Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_28"><sup>28</sup><font color="red">You are those who have stood by me in my trials.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me,</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_31"> <sup>31</sup><font color="red">“Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_33"> <sup>33</sup>But he replied, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_34"> <sup>34</sup>Jesus answered, <font color="red">“I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_35"> <sup>35</sup>Then Jesus asked them, <font color="red">“When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?”</font><br/> “Nothing,” they answered. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_36"> <sup>36</sup>He said to them, <font color="red">“But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don’t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_37"><sup>37</sup><font color="red">It is written: ‘And he was numbered with the transgressors’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 53:12">⚓</a><font color="red">; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_38"> <sup>38</sup>The disciples said, “See, Lord, here are two swords.” <br/> <font color="red">“That’s enough!”</font> he replied. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Prays on the Mount of Olives </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_22_39"> <sup>39</sup>Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_40"><sup>40</sup>On reaching the place, he said to them, <font color="red">“Pray that you will not fall into temptation.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_41"><sup>41</sup>He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed, </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_42"><sup>42</sup><font color="red">“Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_43"><sup>43</sup>An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_44"><sup>44</sup>And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Many early manuscripts do not have verses 43 and 44.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_45"> <sup>45</sup>When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow. </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_46"><sup>46</sup><font color="red">“Why are you sleeping?”</font> he asked them. <font color="red">“Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Arrested </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_22_47"> <sup>47</sup>While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him, </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_48"><sup>48</sup>but Jesus asked him, <font color="red">“Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_49"> <sup>49</sup>When Jesus’ followers saw what was going to happen, they said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?” </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_50"><sup>50</sup>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_51"> <sup>51</sup>But Jesus answered, <font color="red">“No more of this!”</font> And he touched the man’s ear and healed him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_52"> <sup>52</sup>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, <font color="red">“Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_53"><sup>53</sup><font color="red">Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour—when darkness reigns.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Peter Disowns Jesus </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_22_54"> <sup>54</sup>Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance. </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_55"><sup>55</sup>And when some there had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them. </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_56"><sup>56</sup>A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, “This man was with him.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_57"> <sup>57</sup>But he denied it. “Woman, I don’t know him,” he said. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_58"> <sup>58</sup>A little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” <br/> “Man, I am not!” Peter replied. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_59"> <sup>59</sup>About an hour later another asserted, “Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_60"> <sup>60</sup>Peter replied, “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_61"><sup>61</sup>The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: <font color="red">“Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_62"><sup>62</sup>And he went outside and wept bitterly. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Guards Mock Jesus </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_22_63"> <sup>63</sup>The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_64"><sup>64</sup>They blindfolded him and demanded, “Prophesy! Who hit you?” </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_65"><sup>65</sup>And they said many other insulting things to him. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Before Pilate and Herod </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_22_66"> <sup>66</sup>At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and the teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them. </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_67"><sup>67</sup>“If you are the Messiah,” they said, “tell us.” <br/> Jesus answered, <font color="red">“If I tell you, you will not believe me,</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_68"><sup>68</sup><font color="red">and if I asked you, you would not answer.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_69"><sup>69</sup><font color="red">But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_70"> <sup>70</sup>They all asked, “Are you then the Son of God?” <br/> He replied, <font color="red">“You say that I am.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_22_71"> <sup>71</sup>Then they said, “Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips.” <br/></span>
