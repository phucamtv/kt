<div class="title"><h1>19</h1><h3>Zacchaeus the Tax Collector </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_19_1"> <sup>1</sup>Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_2"><sup>2</sup>A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy. </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_3"><sup>3</sup>He wanted to see who Jesus was, but because he was short he could not see over the crowd. </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_4"><sup>4</sup>So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_5"> <sup>5</sup>When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, <font color="red">“Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_6"><sup>6</sup>So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_7"> <sup>7</sup>All the people saw this and began to mutter, “He has gone to be the guest of a sinner.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_8"> <sup>8</sup>But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_9"> <sup>9</sup>Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Ten Minas </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_19_11"> <sup>11</sup>While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once. </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_12"><sup>12</sup>He said: <font color="red">“A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="A mina was about three months’ wages.">⚓</a><font color="red">‘Put this money to work,’ he said, ‘until I come back.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_14"> <sup>14</sup><font color="red">“But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, ‘We don’t want this man to be our king.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_15"> <sup>15</sup><font color="red">“He was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_16"> <sup>16</sup><font color="red">“The first one came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned ten more.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_17"> <sup>17</sup><font color="red">“ ‘Well done, my good servant!’ his master replied. ‘Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_18"> <sup>18</sup><font color="red">“The second came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned five more.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_19"> <sup>19</sup><font color="red">“His master answered, ‘You take charge of five cities.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_20"> <sup>20</sup><font color="red">“Then another servant came and said, ‘Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_22"> <sup>22</sup><font color="red">“His master replied, ‘I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and reaping what I did not sow?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">Why then didn’t you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_24"> <sup>24</sup><font color="red">“Then he said to those standing by, ‘Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_25"> <sup>25</sup><font color="red">“ ‘Sir,’ they said, ‘he already has ten!’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_26"> <sup>26</sup><font color="red">“He replied, ‘I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what they have will be taken away.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them—bring them here and kill them in front of me.’ ”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Comes to Jerusalem as King </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_19_28"> <sup>28</sup>After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_29"><sup>29</sup>As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them, </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">“Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ say, ‘The Lord needs it.’ ”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_32"> <sup>32</sup>Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them. </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_33"><sup>33</sup>As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, “Why are you untying the colt?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_34"> <sup>34</sup>They replied, “The Lord needs it.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_35"> <sup>35</sup>They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it. </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_36"><sup>36</sup>As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_37"> <sup>37</sup>When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen: <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_38">  <sup>38</sup>“Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 118:26">⚓</a><br/><br/>  “Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_39"> <sup>39</sup>Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_40"> <sup>40</sup><font color="red">“I tell you,”</font> he replied, <font color="red">“if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_41"> <sup>41</sup>As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_42"><sup>42</sup>and said, <font color="red">“If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_43"><sup>43</sup><font color="red">The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_44"><sup>44</sup><font color="red">They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God’s coming to you.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus at the Temple </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_19_45"> <sup>45</sup>When Jesus entered the temple courts, he began to drive out those who were selling. </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_46"><sup>46</sup><font color="red">“It is written,”</font> he said to them, <font color="red">“ ‘My house will be a house of prayer’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 56:7">⚓</a><font color="red">; but you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 7:11">⚓</a><font color="red">”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_47"> <sup>47</sup>Every day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_48"><sup>48</sup>Yet they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung on his words. <br/></span>
