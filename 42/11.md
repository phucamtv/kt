<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>Jesus’ Teaching on Prayer </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_2"> <sup>2</sup>He said to them, <font color="red">“When you pray, say: </font><br/>  <font color="red">“ ‘Father,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 11:2 Some manuscripts  Our Father in heaven ">⚓</a><br/>  <font color="red">hallowed be your name, </font><br/>  <font color="red">your kingdom come.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 11:2 Some manuscripts  come. May your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. ">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_3">  <sup>3</sup><font color="red">Give us each day our daily bread.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_4">  <sup>4</sup><font color="red">Forgive us our sins, </font><br/>   <font color="red">for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 11:4 Greek  everyone who is indebted to us ">⚓</a><br/>  <font color="red">And lead us not into temptation.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 11:4 Some manuscripts  temptation, but deliver us from the evil one ">⚓</a><font color="red">’ ”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Suppose you have a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread;</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have no food to offer him.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">And suppose the one inside answers, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is already locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can’t get up and give you anything.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of friendship, yet because of your shameless audacity</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or yet to preserve his good name">⚓</a><font color="red">he will surely get up and give you as much as you need.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_9"> <sup>9</sup><font color="red">“So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_11"> <sup>11</sup><font color="red">“Which of you fathers, if your son asks for</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 11:11 Some manuscripts  for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for ">⚓</a><font color="red">a fish, will give him a snake instead?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus and Beelzebul </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_11_14"> <sup>14</sup>Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed. </span>
<span class="verse lu_11_15"><sup>15</sup>But some of them said, “By Beelzebul, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons.” </span>
<span class="verse lu_11_16"><sup>16</sup>Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_17"> <sup>17</sup>Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: <font color="red">“Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebul.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_21"> <sup>21</sup><font color="red">“When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up his plunder.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_23"> <sup>23</sup><font color="red">“Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_24"> <sup>24</sup><font color="red">“When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_27"> <sup>27</sup>As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, “Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_28"> <sup>28</sup>He replied, <font color="red">“Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Sign of Jonah </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_11_29"> <sup>29</sup>As the crowds increased, Jesus said, <font color="red">“This is a wicked generation. It asks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon’s wisdom; and now something greater than Solomon is here.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and now something greater than Jonah is here.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Lamp of the Body </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_11_33"> <sup>33</sup><font color="red">“No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_34"><sup>34</sup><font color="red">Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek for healthy here implies generous .">⚓</a><font color="red">your whole body also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek for unhealthy here implies stingy .">⚓</a><font color="red">your body also is full of darkness.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_36"><sup>36</sup><font color="red">Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be just as full of light as when a lamp shines its light on you.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Woes on the Pharisees and the Experts in the Law </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_11_37"> <sup>37</sup>When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table. </span>
<span class="verse lu_11_38"><sup>38</sup>But the Pharisee was surprised when he noticed that Jesus did not first wash before the meal. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_39"> <sup>39</sup>Then the Lord said to him, <font color="red">“Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_40"><sup>40</sup><font color="red">You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_41"><sup>41</sup><font color="red">But now as for what is inside you—be generous to the poor, and everything will be clean for you.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_42"> <sup>42</sup><font color="red">“Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_43"> <sup>43</sup><font color="red">“Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_44"> <sup>44</sup><font color="red">“Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which people walk over without knowing it.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_45"> <sup>45</sup>One of the experts in the law answered him, “Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_46"> <sup>46</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_47"> <sup>47</sup><font color="red">“Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your ancestors who killed them.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_48"><sup>48</sup><font color="red">So you testify that you approve of what your ancestors did; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_49"><sup>49</sup><font color="red">Because of this, God in his wisdom said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_50"><sup>50</sup><font color="red">Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world,</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_51"><sup>51</sup><font color="red">from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible for it all.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_52"> <sup>52</sup><font color="red">“Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_11_53"> <sup>53</sup>When Jesus went outside, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions, </span>
<span class="verse lu_11_54"><sup>54</sup>waiting to catch him in something he might say. <br/></span>
