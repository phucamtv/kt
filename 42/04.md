<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>Jesus Is Tested in the Wilderness </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_2"><sup>2</sup>where for forty days he was tempted<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek for tempted can also mean tested .">⚓</a> by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was hungry. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_3"> <sup>3</sup>The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_4"> <sup>4</sup>Jesus answered, <font color="red">“It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 8:3">⚓</a><font color="red">”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_5"> <sup>5</sup>The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_6"><sup>6</sup>And he said to him, “I will give you all their authority and splendor; it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_7"><sup>7</sup>If you worship me, it will all be yours.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_8"> <sup>8</sup>Jesus answered, <font color="red">“It is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:13">⚓</a><font color="red">”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_9"> <sup>9</sup>The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down from here. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_10"><sup>10</sup>For it is written: <br/>  “ ‘He will command his angels concerning you <br/>   to guard you carefully; <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_11">  <sup>11</sup>they will lift you up in their hands, <br/>   so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 91:11,12">⚓</a> ” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_12"> <sup>12</sup>Jesus answered, <font color="red">“It is said: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:16">⚓</a><font color="red">”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_13"> <sup>13</sup>When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Rejected at Nazareth </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_4_14"> <sup>14</sup>Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_15"><sup>15</sup>He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_16"> <sup>16</sup>He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read, </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_17"><sup>17</sup>and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written: <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_18">  <sup>18</sup><font color="red">“The Spirit of the Lord is on me,</font><br/>   <font color="red">because he has anointed me</font><br/>   <font color="red">to proclaim good news to the poor.</font><br/>  <font color="red">He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners</font><br/>   <font color="red">and recovery of sight for the blind,</font><br/>  <font color="red">to set the oppressed free,</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_19">   <sup>19</sup><font color="red">to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 4:19 Isaiah 61:1,2 (see Septuagint); Isaiah 58:6 ">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_21"><sup>21</sup>He began by saying to them, <font color="red">“Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_22"> <sup>22</sup>All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” they asked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_23"> <sup>23</sup>Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Surely you will quote this proverb to me: ‘Physician, heal yourself!’ And you will tell me, ‘Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.’ ”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_24"> <sup>24</sup><font color="red">“Truly I tell you,”</font> he continued, <font color="red">“no prophet is accepted in his hometown.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah’s time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">And there were many in Israel with leprosy</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek word traditionally translated leprosy was used for various diseases affecting the skin.">⚓</a><font color="red">in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed—only Naaman the Syrian.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_28"> <sup>28</sup>All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_29"><sup>29</sup>They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_30"><sup>30</sup>But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Drives Out an Impure Spirit </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_4_31"> <sup>31</sup>Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath he taught the people. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_32"><sup>32</sup>They were amazed at his teaching, because his words had authority. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_33"> <sup>33</sup>In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an impure spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice, </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_34"><sup>34</sup>“Go away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_35"> <sup>35</sup><font color="red">“Be quiet!”</font> Jesus said sternly. <font color="red">“Come out of him!”</font> Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_36"> <sup>36</sup>All the people were amazed and said to each other, “What words these are! With authority and power he gives orders to impure spirits and they come out!” </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_37"><sup>37</sup>And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Heals Many </h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_4_38"> <sup>38</sup>Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_39"><sup>39</sup>So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_40"> <sup>40</sup>At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_41"><sup>41</sup>Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Messiah. <br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_42"> <sup>42</sup>At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_43"><sup>43</sup>But he said, <font color="red">“I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_44"><sup>44</sup>And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea. <br/></span>
