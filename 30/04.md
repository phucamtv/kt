<span class="verse am_4_2">  <sup>2</sup>The Sovereign Lord has sworn by his holiness: <br/>   “The time will surely come <br/>  when you will be taken away with hooks, <br/>   the last of you with fishhooks.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or away in baskets, / the last of you in fish baskets">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_4_3">  <sup>3</sup>You will each go straight out <br/>   through breaches in the wall, <br/>   and you will be cast out toward Harmon,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Masoretic Text; with a different word division of the Hebrew (see Septuagint) out, you mountain of oppression">⚓</a> ” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_4_4">  <sup>4</sup>“Go to Bethel and sin; <br/>   go to Gilgal and sin yet more. <br/>  Bring your sacrifices every morning, <br/>   your tithes every three years.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or days">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_4_5">  <sup>5</sup>Burn leavened bread as a thank offering <br/>   and brag about your freewill offerings— <br/>  boast about them, you Israelites, <br/>   for this is what you love to do,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Sovereign Lord. </aside><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_4_6">  <sup>6</sup>“I gave you empty stomachs in every city <br/>   and lack of bread in every town, <br/>   yet you have not returned to me,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_4_7">  <sup>7</sup>“I also withheld rain from you <br/>   when the harvest was still three months away. <br/>  I sent rain on one town, <br/>   but withheld it from another. <br/>  One field had rain; <br/>   another had none and dried up. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_4_8">  <sup>8</sup>People staggered from town to town for water <br/>   but did not get enough to drink, <br/>   yet you have not returned to me,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_4_9">  <sup>9</sup>“Many times I struck your gardens and vineyards, <br/>   destroying them with blight and mildew. <br/>  Locusts devoured your fig and olive trees, <br/>   yet you have not returned to me,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_4_10">  <sup>10</sup>“I sent plagues among you <br/>   as I did to Egypt. <br/>  I killed your young men with the sword, <br/>   along with your captured horses. <br/>  I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camps, <br/>   yet you have not returned to me,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_4_11">  <sup>11</sup>“I overthrew some of you <br/>   as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. <br/>  You were like a burning stick snatched from the fire, <br/>   yet you have not returned to me,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_4_12">  <sup>12</sup>“Therefore this is what I will do to you, Israel, <br/>   and because I will do this to you, Israel, <br/>   prepare to meet your God.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_4_13">  <sup>13</sup>He who forms the mountains, <br/>   who creates the wind, <br/>   and who reveals his thoughts to mankind, <br/>  who turns dawn to darkness, <br/>   and treads on the heights of the earth— <br/>   the Lord God Almighty is his name. <br/></span>
