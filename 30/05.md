<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>A Lament and Call to Repentance </h3></div>
<span class="verse am_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>Hear this word, Israel, this lament I take up concerning you: <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_2">  <sup>2</sup>“Fallen is Virgin Israel, <br/>   never to rise again, <br/>  deserted in her own land, <br/>   with no one to lift her up.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_3"> <sup>3</sup>This is what the Sovereign Lord says to Israel: <br/>  “Your city that marches out a thousand strong <br/>   will have only a hundred left; <br/>  your town that marches out a hundred strong <br/>   will have only ten left.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_4"> <sup>4</sup>This is what the Lord says to Israel: <br/>  “Seek me and live; <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_5">   <sup>5</sup>do not seek Bethel, <br/>  do not go to Gilgal, <br/>   do not journey to Beersheba. <br/>  For Gilgal will surely go into exile, <br/>   and Bethel will be reduced to nothing.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew aven, a reference to Beth Aven (a derogatory name for Bethel); see Hosea 4:15.">⚓</a> ” <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_6">  <sup>6</sup>Seek the Lord and live, <br/>   or he will sweep through the tribes of Joseph like a fire; <br/>  it will devour them, <br/>   and Bethel will have no one to quench it. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_7">  <sup>7</sup>There are those who turn justice into bitterness <br/>   and cast righteousness to the ground. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_8">  <sup>8</sup>He who made the Pleiades and Orion, <br/>   who turns midnight into dawn <br/>   and darkens day into night, <br/>  who calls for the waters of the sea <br/>   and pours them out over the face of the land— <br/>   the Lord is his name. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_9">  <sup>9</sup>With a blinding flash he destroys the stronghold <br/>   and brings the fortified city to ruin. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_10">  <sup>10</sup>There are those who hate the one who upholds justice in court <br/>   and detest the one who tells the truth. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_11">  <sup>11</sup>You levy a straw tax on the poor <br/>   and impose a tax on their grain. <br/>  Therefore, though you have built stone mansions, <br/>   you will not live in them; <br/>  though you have planted lush vineyards, <br/>   you will not drink their wine. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_12">  <sup>12</sup>For I know how many are your offenses <br/>   and how great your sins. <br/><br/>  There are those who oppress the innocent and take bribes <br/>   and deprive the poor of justice in the courts. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_13">  <sup>13</sup>Therefore the prudent keep quiet in such times, <br/>   for the times are evil. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_14">  <sup>14</sup>Seek good, not evil, <br/>   that you may live. <br/>  Then the Lord God Almighty will be with you, <br/>   just as you say he is. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_15">  <sup>15</sup>Hate evil, love good; <br/>   maintain justice in the courts. <br/>  Perhaps the Lord God Almighty will have mercy <br/>   on the remnant of Joseph. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_16"> <sup>16</sup>Therefore this is what the Lord, the Lord God Almighty, says: <br/>  “There will be wailing in all the streets <br/>   and cries of anguish in every public square. <br/>  The farmers will be summoned to weep <br/>   and the mourners to wail. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_17">  <sup>17</sup>There will be wailing in all the vineyards, <br/>   for I will pass through your midst,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">says the Lord. </aside><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Day of the Lord </h3></div>
<span class="verse am_5_18">  <sup>18</sup>Woe to you who long <br/>   for the day of the Lord! <br/>  Why do you long for the day of the Lord? <br/>   That day will be darkness, not light. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_19">  <sup>19</sup>It will be as though a man fled from a lion <br/>   only to meet a bear, <br/>  as though he entered his house <br/>   and rested his hand on the wall <br/>   only to have a snake bite him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_20">  <sup>20</sup>Will not the day of the Lord be darkness, not light— <br/>   pitch-dark, without a ray of brightness? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_21">  <sup>21</sup>“I hate, I despise your religious festivals; <br/>   your assemblies are a stench to me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_22">  <sup>22</sup>Even though you bring me burnt offerings and grain offerings, <br/>   I will not accept them. <br/>  Though you bring choice fellowship offerings, <br/>   I will have no regard for them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_23">  <sup>23</sup>Away with the noise of your songs! <br/>   I will not listen to the music of your harps. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_24">  <sup>24</sup>But let justice roll on like a river, <br/>   righteousness like a never-failing stream! <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_25">  <sup>25</sup>“Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings <br/>   forty years in the wilderness, people of Israel? <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_26">  <sup>26</sup>You have lifted up the shrine of your king, <br/>   the pedestal of your idols, <br/>   the star of your god<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or lifted up Sakkuth your king / and Kaiwan your idols, / your star-gods ; Septuagint lifted up the shrine of Molek / and the star of your god Rephan, / their idols">⚓</a> — <br/>   which you made for yourselves. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_5_27">  <sup>27</sup>Therefore I will send you into exile beyond Damascus,” <br/>   says the Lord, whose name is God Almighty. <br/></span>
