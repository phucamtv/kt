<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>Woe to the Complacent </h3></div>
<span class="verse am_6_1">  <sup>1</sup>Woe to you who are complacent in Zion, <br/>   and to you who feel secure on Mount Samaria, <br/>  you notable men of the foremost nation, <br/>   to whom the people of Israel come! <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_6_2">  <sup>2</sup>Go to Kalneh and look at it; <br/>   go from there to great Hamath, <br/>   and then go down to Gath in Philistia. <br/>  Are they better off than your two kingdoms? <br/>   Is their land larger than yours? <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_6_3">  <sup>3</sup>You put off the day of disaster <br/>   and bring near a reign of terror. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_6_4">  <sup>4</sup>You lie on beds adorned with ivory <br/>   and lounge on your couches. <br/>  You dine on choice lambs <br/>   and fattened calves. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_6_5">  <sup>5</sup>You strum away on your harps like David <br/>   and improvise on musical instruments. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_6_6">  <sup>6</sup>You drink wine by the bowlful <br/>   and use the finest lotions, <br/>   but you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_6_7">  <sup>7</sup>Therefore you will be among the first to go into exile; <br/>   your feasting and lounging will end. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Lord Abhors the Pride of Israel </h3></div>
<span class="verse am_6_8"> <sup>8</sup>The Sovereign Lord has sworn by himself—the Lord God Almighty declares: <br/>  “I abhor the pride of Jacob <br/>   and detest his fortresses; <br/>  I will deliver up the city <br/>   and everything in it.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_6_9"> <sup>9</sup>If ten people are left in one house, they too will die. </span>
<span class="verse am_6_10"><sup>10</sup>And if the relative who comes to carry the bodies out of the house to burn them<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or to make a funeral fire in honor of the dead">⚓</a> asks anyone who might be hiding there, “Is anyone else with you?” and he says, “No,” then he will go on to say, “Hush! We must not mention the name of the Lord.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_6_11">  <sup>11</sup>For the Lord has given the command, <br/>   and he will smash the great house into pieces <br/>   and the small house into bits. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_6_12">  <sup>12</sup>Do horses run on the rocky crags? <br/>   Does one plow the sea<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="With a different word division of the Hebrew; Masoretic Text plow there">⚓</a> with oxen? <br/>  But you have turned justice into poison <br/>   and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness— <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_6_13">  <sup>13</sup>you who rejoice in the conquest of Lo Debar<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means nothing.">⚓</a><br/>   and say, “Did we not take Karnaim<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means horns ; horn here symbolizes strength.">⚓</a> by our own strength?” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_6_14">  <sup>14</sup>For the Lord God Almighty declares, <br/>   “I will stir up a nation against you, Israel, <br/>  that will oppress you all the way <br/>   from Lebo Hamath to the valley of the Arabah.” <br/></span>
