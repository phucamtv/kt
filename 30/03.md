<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>Witnesses Summoned Against Israel </h3></div>
<span class="verse am_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>Hear this word, people of Israel, the word the Lord has spoken against you—against the whole family I brought up out of Egypt: <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_3_2">  <sup>2</sup>“You only have I chosen <br/>   of all the families of the earth; <br/>  therefore I will punish you <br/>   for all your sins.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_3_3">  <sup>3</sup>Do two walk together <br/>   unless they have agreed to do so? <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_3_4">  <sup>4</sup>Does a lion roar in the thicket <br/>   when it has no prey? <br/>  Does it growl in its den <br/>   when it has caught nothing? <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_3_5">  <sup>5</sup>Does a bird swoop down to a trap on the ground <br/>   when no bait is there? <br/>  Does a trap spring up from the ground <br/>   if it has not caught anything? <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_3_6">  <sup>6</sup>When a trumpet sounds in a city, <br/>   do not the people tremble? <br/>  When disaster comes to a city, <br/>   has not the Lord caused it? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_3_7">  <sup>7</sup>Surely the Sovereign Lord does nothing <br/>   without revealing his plan <br/>   to his servants the prophets. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_3_8">  <sup>8</sup>The lion has roared— <br/>   who will not fear? <br/>  The Sovereign Lord has spoken— <br/>   who can but prophesy? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_3_9">  <sup>9</sup>Proclaim to the fortresses of Ashdod <br/>   and to the fortresses of Egypt: <br/>  “Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria; <br/>   see the great unrest within her <br/>   and the oppression among her people.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_3_10">  <sup>10</sup>“They do not know how to do right,” declares the Lord, <br/>   “who store up in their fortresses <br/>   what they have plundered and looted.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_3_11"> <sup>11</sup>Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: <br/>  “An enemy will overrun your land, <br/>   pull down your strongholds <br/>   and plunder your fortresses.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_3_12"> <sup>12</sup>This is what the Lord says: <br/>  “As a shepherd rescues from the lion’s mouth <br/>   only two leg bones or a piece of an ear, <br/>  so will the Israelites living in Samaria be rescued, <br/>   with only the head of a bed <br/>   and a piece of fabric<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this phrase is uncertain.">⚓</a> from a couch.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Israelites be rescued, / those who sit in Samaria / on the edge of their beds / and in Damascus on their couches.">⚓</a> ” <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_3_13"> <sup>13</sup>“Hear this and testify against the descendants of Jacob,” declares the Lord, the Lord God Almighty. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_3_14">  <sup>14</sup>“On the day I punish Israel for her sins, <br/>   I will destroy the altars of Bethel; <br/>  the horns of the altar will be cut off <br/>   and fall to the ground. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_3_15">  <sup>15</sup>I will tear down the winter house <br/>   along with the summer house; <br/>  the houses adorned with ivory will be destroyed <br/>   and the mansions will be demolished,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/></span>
