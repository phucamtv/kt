<div class="title"><h1>9</h1><h3>Israel to Be Destroyed </h3></div>
<span class="verse am_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>I saw the Lord standing by the altar, and he said: <br/>  “Strike the tops of the pillars <br/>   so that the thresholds shake. <br/>  Bring them down on the heads of all the people; <br/>   those who are left I will kill with the sword. <br/>  Not one will get away, <br/>   none will escape. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_9_2">  <sup>2</sup>Though they dig down to the depths below, <br/>   from there my hand will take them. <br/>  Though they climb up to the heavens above, <br/>   from there I will bring them down. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_9_3">  <sup>3</sup>Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, <br/>   there I will hunt them down and seize them. <br/>  Though they hide from my eyes at the bottom of the sea, <br/>   there I will command the serpent to bite them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_9_4">  <sup>4</sup>Though they are driven into exile by their enemies, <br/>   there I will command the sword to slay them. <br/><br/>  “I will keep my eye on them <br/>   for harm and not for good.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_9_5">  <sup>5</sup>The Lord, the Lord Almighty— <br/>  he touches the earth and it melts, <br/>   and all who live in it mourn; <br/>  the whole land rises like the Nile, <br/>   then sinks like the river of Egypt; <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_9_6">  <sup>6</sup>he builds his lofty palace<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this phrase is uncertain.">⚓</a> in the heavens <br/>   and sets its foundation<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.">⚓</a> on the earth; <br/>  he calls for the waters of the sea <br/>   and pours them out over the face of the land— <br/>   the Lord is his name. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_9_7">  <sup>7</sup>“Are not you Israelites <br/>   the same to me as the Cushites<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, people from the upper Nile region">⚓</a> ?” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/>  “Did I not bring Israel up from Egypt, <br/>   the Philistines from Caphtor<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, Crete">⚓</a><br/>   and the Arameans from Kir? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_9_8">  <sup>8</sup>“Surely the eyes of the Sovereign Lord<br/>   are on the sinful kingdom. <br/>  I will destroy it <br/>   from the face of the earth. <br/>  Yet I will not totally destroy <br/>   the descendants of Jacob,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_9_9">  <sup>9</sup>“For I will give the command, <br/>   and I will shake the people of Israel <br/>   among all the nations <br/>  as grain is shaken in a sieve, <br/>   and not a pebble will reach the ground. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_9_10">  <sup>10</sup>All the sinners among my people <br/>   will die by the sword, <br/>  all those who say, <br/>   ‘Disaster will not overtake or meet us.’ <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Israel’s Restoration </h3></div>
<span class="verse am_9_11"> <sup>11</sup>“In that day <br/>  I will restore David’s fallen shelter— <br/>   I will repair its broken walls <br/>   and restore its ruins— <br/>   and will rebuild it as it used to be, <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_9_12">  <sup>12</sup>so that they may possess the remnant of Edom <br/>   and all the nations that bear my name,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew; Septuagint so that the remnant of people / and all the nations that bear my name may seek me">⚓</a> ” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord, who will do these things. </aside><br/></span>
<span class="verse am_9_13"> <sup>13</sup>“The days are coming,” declares the Lord, <br/>  “when the reaper will be overtaken by the plowman <br/>   and the planter by the one treading grapes. <br/>  New wine will drip from the mountains <br/>   and flow from all the hills, <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_9_14">   <sup>14</sup>and I will bring my people Israel back from exile.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or will restore the fortunes of my people Israel">⚓</a><br/><br/>  “They will rebuild the ruined cities and live in them. <br/>   They will plant vineyards and drink their wine; <br/>   they will make gardens and eat their fruit. <br/></span>
<span class="verse am_9_15">  <sup>15</sup>I will plant Israel in their own land, <br/>   never again to be uprooted <br/>   from the land I have given them,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">says the Lord your God. </aside><br/></span>
