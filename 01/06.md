<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>Wickedness in the World </h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_2"><sup>2</sup>the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_3"><sup>3</sup>Then the Lord said, “My Spirit will not contend with<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or My spirit will not remain in">⚓</a> humans forever, for they are mortal<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or corrupt">⚓</a> ; their days will be a hundred and twenty years.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_6_4"> <sup>4</sup>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_6_5"> <sup>5</sup>The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_6"><sup>6</sup>The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled. </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_7"><sup>7</sup>So the Lord said, “I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_8"><sup>8</sup>But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Noah and the Flood </h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_6_9"> <sup>9</sup>This is the account of Noah and his family. <br/> Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God. </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_10"><sup>10</sup>Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_6_11"> <sup>11</sup>Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight and was full of violence. </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_12"><sup>12</sup>God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_13"><sup>13</sup>So God said to Noah, “I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_14"><sup>14</sup>So make yourself an ark of cypress<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.">⚓</a> wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out. </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_15"><sup>15</sup>This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high or about 135 meters long, 23 meters wide and 14 meters high">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse sa_6_16"><sup>16</sup>Make a roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 18 inches or about 45 centimeters">⚓</a> high all around.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this clause is uncertain.">⚓</a> Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks. </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_17"><sup>17</sup>I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish. </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_18"><sup>18</sup>But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you. </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_19"><sup>19</sup>You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_20"><sup>20</sup>Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive. </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_21"><sup>21</sup>You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_6_22"> <sup>22</sup>Noah did everything just as God commanded him. <br/></span>
