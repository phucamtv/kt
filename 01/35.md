<div class="title"><h1>35</h1><h3>Jacob Returns to Bethel </h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_35_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then God said to Jacob, “Go up to Bethel and settle there, and build an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_35_2"> <sup>2</sup>So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you, and purify yourselves and change your clothes. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_3"><sup>3</sup>Then come, let us go up to Bethel, where I will build an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_4"><sup>4</sup>So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the oak at Shechem. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_5"><sup>5</sup>Then they set out, and the terror of God fell on the towns all around them so that no one pursued them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_35_6"> <sup>6</sup>Jacob and all the people with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_7"><sup>7</sup>There he built an altar, and he called the place El Bethel,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means God of Bethel.">⚓</a> because it was there that God revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_35_8"> <sup>8</sup>Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried under the oak outside Bethel. So it was named Allon Bakuth.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means oak of weeping.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_35_9"> <sup>9</sup>After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, Northwest Mesopotamia; also in verse 26">⚓</a> God appeared to him again and blessed him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_10"><sup>10</sup>God said to him, “Your name is Jacob,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means he grasps the heel , a Hebrew idiom for he deceives .">⚓</a> but you will no longer be called Jacob; your name will be Israel.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="probably means he struggles with God.">⚓</a> ” So he named him Israel. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_35_11"> <sup>11</sup>And God said to him, “I am God Almighty<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew El-Shaddai">⚓</a> ; be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will be among your descendants. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_12"><sup>12</sup>The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I also give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_13"><sup>13</sup>Then God went up from him at the place where he had talked with him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_35_14"> <sup>14</sup>Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_15"><sup>15</sup>Jacob called the place where God had talked with him Bethel.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means house of God.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Deaths of Rachel and Isaac </h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_35_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then they moved on from Bethel. While they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and had great difficulty. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_17"><sup>17</sup>And as she was having great difficulty in childbirth, the midwife said to her, “Don’t despair, for you have another son.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_18"><sup>18</sup>As she breathed her last—for she was dying—she named her son Ben-Oni.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means son of my trouble.">⚓</a> But his father named him Benjamin.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means son of my right hand.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_35_19"> <sup>19</sup>So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_20"><sup>20</sup>Over her tomb Jacob set up a pillar, and to this day that pillar marks Rachel’s tomb. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_35_21"> <sup>21</sup>Israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_22"><sup>22</sup>While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard of it. <br/> Jacob had twelve sons: <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_35_23">  <sup>23</sup>The sons of Leah: <br/>    Reuben the firstborn of Jacob, <br/>    Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_35_24">  <sup>24</sup>The sons of Rachel: <br/>    Joseph and Benjamin. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_35_25">  <sup>25</sup>The sons of Rachel’s servant Bilhah: <br/>    Dan and Naphtali. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_35_26">  <sup>26</sup>The sons of Leah’s servant Zilpah: <br/>    Gad and Asher. <br/> These were the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_35_27"> <sup>27</sup>Jacob came home to his father Isaac in Mamre, near Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_28"><sup>28</sup>Isaac lived a hundred and eighty years. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_29"><sup>29</sup>Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of years. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. <br/></span>
