<div class="title"><h1>16</h1><h3>Hagar and Ishmael </h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_16_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar; </span>
<span class="verse sa_16_2"><sup>2</sup>so she said to Abram, “The Lord has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my slave; perhaps I can build a family through her.” <br/> Abram agreed to what Sarai said. </span>
<span class="verse sa_16_3"><sup>3</sup>So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian slave Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife. </span>
<span class="verse sa_16_4"><sup>4</sup>He slept with Hagar, and she conceived. <br/> When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress. </span>
<span class="verse sa_16_5"><sup>5</sup>Then Sarai said to Abram, “You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my slave in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the Lord judge between you and me.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_16_6"> <sup>6</sup>“Your slave is in your hands,” Abram said. “Do with her whatever you think best.” Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_16_7"> <sup>7</sup>The angel of the Lord found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur. </span>
<span class="verse sa_16_8"><sup>8</sup>And he said, “Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?” <br/> “I’m running away from my mistress Sarai,” she answered. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_16_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then the angel of the Lord told her, “Go back to your mistress and submit to her.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_16_10"><sup>10</sup>The angel added, “I will increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_16_11"> <sup>11</sup>The angel of the Lord also said to her: <br/>  “You are now pregnant <br/>   and you will give birth to a son. <br/>  You shall name him Ishmael,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means God hears.">⚓</a><br/>   for the Lord has heard of your misery. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_16_12">  <sup>12</sup>He will be a wild donkey of a man; <br/>   his hand will be against everyone <br/>   and everyone’s hand against him, <br/>  and he will live in hostility <br/>   toward<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or live to the east / of">⚓</a> all his brothers.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_16_13"> <sup>13</sup>She gave this name to the Lord who spoke to her: “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “I have now seen<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or seen the back of">⚓</a> the One who sees me.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_16_14"><sup>14</sup>That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means well of the Living One who sees me.">⚓</a> ; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_16_15"> <sup>15</sup>So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne. </span>
<span class="verse sa_16_16"><sup>16</sup>Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael. <br/></span>
