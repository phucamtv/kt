<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>Cain and Abel </h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>Adam<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or The man">⚓</a> made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="sounds like the Hebrew for brought forth or acquired.">⚓</a> She said, “With the help of the Lord I have brought forth<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or have acquired">⚓</a> a man.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_2"><sup>2</sup>Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. <br/> Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil. </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_3"><sup>3</sup>In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_4"><sup>4</sup>And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering, </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_5"><sup>5</sup>but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then the Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_7"><sup>7</sup>If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_8"> <sup>8</sup>Now Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out to the field.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Samaritan Pentateuch, Septuagint, Vulgate and Syriac; Masoretic Text does not have “Let’s go out to the field.”">⚓</a> While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then the Lord said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” <br/> “I don’t know,” he replied. “Am I my brother’s keeper?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_10"> <sup>10</sup>The Lord said, “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground. </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_11"><sup>11</sup>Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_12"><sup>12</sup>When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_13"> <sup>13</sup>Cain said to the Lord, “My punishment is more than I can bear. </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_14"><sup>14</sup>Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_15"> <sup>15</sup>But the Lord said to him, “Not so<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint, Vulgate and Syriac; Hebrew Very well">⚓</a> ; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.” Then the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_16"><sup>16</sup>So Cain went out from the Lord’s presence and lived in the land of Nod,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means wandering (see verses 12 and 14).">⚓</a> east of Eden. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_17"> <sup>17</sup>Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch. </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_18"><sup>18</sup>To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_19"> <sup>19</sup>Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah. </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_20"><sup>20</sup>Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock. </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_21"><sup>21</sup>His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes. </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_22"><sup>22</sup>Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or who instructed all who work in">⚓</a> bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain’s sister was Naamah. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_23"> <sup>23</sup>Lamech said to his wives, <br/>  “Adah and Zillah, listen to me; <br/>   wives of Lamech, hear my words. <br/>  I have killed a man for wounding me, <br/>   a young man for injuring me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_24">  <sup>24</sup>If Cain is avenged seven times, <br/>   then Lamech seventy-seven times.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_25"> <sup>25</sup>Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="probably means granted.">⚓</a> saying, “God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_26"><sup>26</sup>Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. <br/> At that time people began to call on<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or to proclaim">⚓</a> the name of the Lord. <br/></span>
