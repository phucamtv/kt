<div class="title"><h1>2</h1></div>
<span class="verse sa_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_2">  <sup>2</sup>By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_3"><sup>3</sup>Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Adam and Eve </h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_2_4"> <sup>4</sup>This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the Lord God made the earth and the heavens. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_5"> <sup>5</sup>Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or land ; also in verse 6">⚓</a> and no plant had yet sprung up, for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground, </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_6"><sup>6</sup>but streams<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or mist">⚓</a> came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground. </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_7"><sup>7</sup>Then the Lord God formed a man<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew for man (adam) sounds like and may be related to the Hebrew for ground (adamah) ; it is also the name Adam (see verse 20).">⚓</a> from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_8"> <sup>8</sup>Now the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_9"><sup>9</sup>The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground—trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_10"> <sup>10</sup>A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_11"><sup>11</sup>The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_12"><sup>12</sup>(The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or good ; pearls">⚓</a> and onyx are also there.) </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_13"><sup>13</sup>The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Possibly southeast Mesopotamia">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_14"><sup>14</sup>The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_15"> <sup>15</sup>The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_16"><sup>16</sup>And the Lord God commanded the man, “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_17"><sup>17</sup>but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_18"> <sup>18</sup>The Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_19"> <sup>19</sup>Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_20"><sup>20</sup>So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. <br/> But for Adam<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or the man">⚓</a> no suitable helper was found. </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_21"><sup>21</sup>So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man’s ribs<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or took part of the man’s side">⚓</a> and then closed up the place with flesh. </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_22"><sup>22</sup>Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or part">⚓</a> he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_23"> <sup>23</sup>The man said, <br/>  “This is now bone of my bones <br/>   and flesh of my flesh; <br/>  she shall be called ‘woman,’ <br/>   for she was taken out of man.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_24"><sup>24</sup>That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_25"> <sup>25</sup>Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame. <br/></span>
