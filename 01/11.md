<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>The Tower of Babel </h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. </span>
<span class="verse sa_11_2"><sup>2</sup>As people moved eastward,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or from the east ; or in the east">⚓</a> they found a plain in Shinar<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, Babylonia">⚓</a> and settled there. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_11_3"> <sup>3</sup>They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. </span>
<span class="verse sa_11_4"><sup>4</sup>Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_11_5"> <sup>5</sup>But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. </span>
<span class="verse sa_11_6"><sup>6</sup>The Lord said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. </span>
<span class="verse sa_11_7"><sup>7</sup>Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_11_8"> <sup>8</sup>So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. </span>
<span class="verse sa_11_9"><sup>9</sup>That is why it was called Babel<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, Babylon; Babel sounds like the Hebrew for confused .">⚓</a> —because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth. <br/></span>
