<div class="title"><h1>23</h1><h3>The Death of Sarah </h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_23_1"> <sup>1</sup>Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven years old. </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_2"><sup>2</sup>She died at Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_23_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or the descendants of Heth ; also in verses 5, 7, 10, 16, 18 and 20">⚓</a> He said, </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_4"><sup>4</sup>“I am a foreigner and stranger among you. Sell me some property for a burial site here so I can bury my dead.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_23_5"> <sup>5</sup>The Hittites replied to Abraham, </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_6"><sup>6</sup>“Sir, listen to us. You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_23_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites. </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_8"><sup>8</sup>He said to them, “If you are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_9"><sup>9</sup>so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_23_10"> <sup>10</sup>Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people and he replied to Abraham in the hearing of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city. </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_11"><sup>11</sup>“No, my lord,” he said. “Listen to me; I give<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or sell">⚓</a> you the field, and I give<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or sell">⚓</a> you the cave that is in it. I give<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or sell">⚓</a> it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_23_12"> <sup>12</sup>Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_13"><sup>13</sup>and he said to Ephron in their hearing, “Listen to me, if you will. I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so I can bury my dead there.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_23_14"> <sup>14</sup>Ephron answered Abraham, </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_15"><sup>15</sup>“Listen to me, my lord; the land is worth four hundred shekels<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 10 pounds or about 4.6 kilograms">⚓</a> of silver, but what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_23_16"> <sup>16</sup>Abraham agreed to Ephron’s terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weight current among the merchants. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_23_17"> <sup>17</sup>So Ephron’s field in Machpelah near Mamre—both the field and the cave in it, and all the trees within the borders of the field—was deeded </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_18"><sup>18</sup>to Abraham as his property in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of the city. </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_19"><sup>19</sup>Afterward Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre (which is at Hebron) in the land of Canaan. </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_20"><sup>20</sup>So the field and the cave in it were deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a burial site. <br/></span>
