<span class="verse sa_46_1"> <sup>1</sup>So Israel set out with all that was his, and when he reached Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_46_2"> <sup>2</sup>And God spoke to Israel in a vision at night and said, “Jacob! Jacob!” <br/> “Here I am,” he replied. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_46_3"> <sup>3</sup>“I am God, the God of your father,” he said. “Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there. </span>
<span class="verse sa_46_4"><sup>4</sup>I will go down to Egypt with you, and I will surely bring you back again. And Joseph’s own hand will close your eyes.” <br/></span>

<span class="verse sa_46_32"><sup>32</sup>The men are shepherds; they tend livestock, and they have brought along their flocks and herds and everything they own.’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_46_33"><sup>33</sup>When Pharaoh calls you in and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_46_34"><sup>34</sup>you should answer, ‘Your servants have tended livestock from our boyhood on, just as our fathers did.’ Then you will be allowed to settle in the region of Goshen, for all shepherds are detestable to the Egyptians.” <br/></span>
