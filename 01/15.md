<div class="title"><h1>15</h1><h3>The Lord’s Covenant With Abram </h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_15_1"> <sup>1</sup>After this, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: <br/>  “Do not be afraid, Abram. <br/>   I am your shield,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or sovereign">⚓</a><br/>   your very great reward.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or shield; / your reward will be very great">⚓</a> ” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_15_2"> <sup>2</sup>But Abram said, “Sovereign Lord, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this phrase is uncertain.">⚓</a> my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?” </span>
<span class="verse sa_15_3"><sup>3</sup>And Abram said, “You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_15_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then the word of the Lord came to him: “This man will not be your heir, but a son who is your own flesh and blood will be your heir.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_15_5"><sup>5</sup>He took him outside and said, “Look up at the sky and count the stars—if indeed you can count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or seed">⚓</a> be.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_15_6"> <sup>6</sup>Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_15_7"> <sup>7</sup>He also said to him, “I am the Lord, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_15_8"> <sup>8</sup>But Abram said, “Sovereign Lord, how can I know that I will gain possession of it?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_15_9"> <sup>9</sup>So the Lord said to him, “Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_15_10"> <sup>10</sup>Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half. </span>
<span class="verse sa_15_11"><sup>11</sup>Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_15_12"> <sup>12</sup>As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_15_13"><sup>13</sup>Then the Lord said to him, “Know for certain that for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there. </span>
<span class="verse sa_15_14"><sup>14</sup>But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions. </span>
<span class="verse sa_15_15"><sup>15</sup>You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age. </span>
<span class="verse sa_15_16"><sup>16</sup>In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_15_17"> <sup>17</sup>When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces. </span>
<span class="verse sa_15_18"><sup>18</sup>On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram and said, “To your descendants I give this land, from the Wadi<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or river">⚓</a> of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates— </span>
<span class="verse sa_15_19"><sup>19</sup>the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, </span>
<span class="verse sa_15_20"><sup>20</sup>Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, </span>
<span class="verse sa_15_21"><sup>21</sup>Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.” <br/></span>
