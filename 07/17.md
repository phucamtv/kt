<div class="title"><h1>17</h1><h3>Micah’s Idols </h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_17_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim </span>
<span class="verse cac_17_2"><sup>2</sup>said to his mother, “The eleven hundred shekels<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 28 pounds or about 13 kilograms">⚓</a> of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curse—I have that silver with me; I took it.” <br/> Then his mother said, “The Lord bless you, my son!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_17_3"> <sup>3</sup>When he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, “I solemnly consecrate my silver to the Lord for my son to make an image overlaid with silver. I will give it back to you.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_17_4"> <sup>4</sup>So after he returned the silver to his mother, she took two hundred shekels<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 5 pounds or about 2.3 kilograms">⚓</a> of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who used them to make the idol. And it was put in Micah’s house. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_17_5"> <sup>5</sup>Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some household gods and installed one of his sons as his priest. </span>
<span class="verse cac_17_6"><sup>6</sup>In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_17_7"> <sup>7</sup>A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, who had been living within the clan of Judah, </span>
<span class="verse cac_17_8"><sup>8</sup>left that town in search of some other place to stay. On his way<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or To carry on his profession">⚓</a> he came to Micah’s house in the hill country of Ephraim. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_17_9"> <sup>9</sup>Micah asked him, “Where are you from?” <br/> “I’m a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah,” he said, “and I’m looking for a place to stay.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_17_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then Micah said to him, “Live with me and be my father and priest, and I’ll give you ten shekels<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 4 ounces or about 115 grams">⚓</a> of silver a year, your clothes and your food.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_17_11"><sup>11</sup>So the Levite agreed to live with him, and the young man became like one of his sons to him. </span>
<span class="verse cac_17_12"><sup>12</sup>Then Micah installed the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in his house. </span>
<span class="verse cac_17_13"><sup>13</sup>And Micah said, “Now I know that the Lord will be good to me, since this Levite has become my priest.” <br/></span>
