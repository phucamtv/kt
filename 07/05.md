<span class="verse cac_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song: <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_2">  <sup>2</sup>“When the princes in Israel take the lead, <br/>   when the people willingly offer themselves— <br/>   praise the Lord! <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_3">  <sup>3</sup>“Hear this, you kings! Listen, you rulers! <br/>   I, even I, will sing to<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or of">⚓</a> the Lord; <br/>   I will praise the Lord, the God of Israel, in song. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_4">  <sup>4</sup>“When you, Lord, went out from Seir, <br/>   when you marched from the land of Edom, <br/>  the earth shook, the heavens poured, <br/>   the clouds poured down water. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_5">  <sup>5</sup>The mountains quaked before the Lord, the One of Sinai, <br/>   before the Lord, the God of Israel. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_6">  <sup>6</sup>“In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, <br/>   in the days of Jael, the highways were abandoned; <br/>   travelers took to winding paths. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_7">  <sup>7</sup>Villagers in Israel would not fight; <br/>   they held back until I, Deborah, arose, <br/>   until I arose, a mother in Israel. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_8">  <sup>8</sup>God chose new leaders <br/>   when war came to the city gates, <br/>  but not a shield or spear was seen <br/>   among forty thousand in Israel. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_9">  <sup>9</sup>My heart is with Israel’s princes, <br/>   with the willing volunteers among the people. <br/>   Praise the Lord! <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_10">  <sup>10</sup>“You who ride on white donkeys, <br/>   sitting on your saddle blankets, <br/>   and you who walk along the road, <br/>  consider </span>
<span class="verse cac_5_11">  <sup>11</sup>the voice of the singers<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.">⚓</a> at the watering places. <br/>   They recite the victories of the Lord, <br/>   the victories of his villagers in Israel. <br/>  “Then the people of the Lord<br/>   went down to the city gates. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_12">  <sup>12</sup>‘Wake up, wake up, Deborah! <br/>   Wake up, wake up, break out in song! <br/>  Arise, Barak! <br/>   Take captive your captives, son of Abinoam.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_13">  <sup>13</sup>“The remnant of the nobles came down; <br/>   the people of the Lord came down to me against the mighty. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_14">  <sup>14</sup>Some came from Ephraim, whose roots were in Amalek; <br/>   Benjamin was with the people who followed you. <br/>  From Makir captains came down, <br/>   from Zebulun those who bear a commander’s<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.">⚓</a> staff. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_15">  <sup>15</sup>The princes of Issachar were with Deborah; <br/>   yes, Issachar was with Barak, <br/>   sent under his command into the valley. <br/>  In the districts of Reuben <br/>   there was much searching of heart. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_16">  <sup>16</sup>Why did you stay among the sheep pens<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or the campfires ; or the saddlebags">⚓</a><br/>   to hear the whistling for the flocks? <br/>  In the districts of Reuben <br/>   there was much searching of heart. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_17">  <sup>17</sup>Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan. <br/>   And Dan, why did he linger by the ships? <br/>  Asher remained on the coast <br/>   and stayed in his coves. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_18">  <sup>18</sup>The people of Zebulun risked their very lives; <br/>   so did Naphtali on the terraced fields. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_19">  <sup>19</sup>“Kings came, they fought, <br/>   the kings of Canaan fought. <br/>  At Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo, <br/>   they took no plunder of silver. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_20">  <sup>20</sup>From the heavens the stars fought, <br/>   from their courses they fought against Sisera. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_21">  <sup>21</sup>The river Kishon swept them away, <br/>   the age-old river, the river Kishon. <br/>   March on, my soul; be strong! <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_22">  <sup>22</sup>Then thundered the horses’ hooves— <br/>   galloping, galloping go his mighty steeds. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_23">  <sup>23</sup>‘Curse Meroz,’ said the angel of the Lord. <br/>   ‘Curse its people bitterly, <br/>  because they did not come to help the Lord, <br/>   to help the Lord against the mighty.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_24">  <sup>24</sup>“Most blessed of women be Jael, <br/>   the wife of Heber the Kenite, <br/>   most blessed of tent-dwelling women. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_25">  <sup>25</sup>He asked for water, and she gave him milk; <br/>   in a bowl fit for nobles she brought him curdled milk. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_26">  <sup>26</sup>Her hand reached for the tent peg, <br/>   her right hand for the workman’s hammer. <br/>  She struck Sisera, she crushed his head, <br/>   she shattered and pierced his temple. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_27">  <sup>27</sup>At her feet he sank, <br/>   he fell; there he lay. <br/>  At her feet he sank, he fell; <br/>   where he sank, there he fell—dead. <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_28">  <sup>28</sup>“Through the window peered Sisera’s mother; <br/>   behind the lattice she cried out, <br/>  ‘Why is his chariot so long in coming? <br/>   Why is the clatter of his chariots delayed?’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_29">  <sup>29</sup>The wisest of her ladies answer her; <br/>   indeed, she keeps saying to herself, <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_30">  <sup>30</sup>‘Are they not finding and dividing the spoils: <br/>   a woman or two for each man, <br/>  colorful garments as plunder for Sisera, <br/>   colorful garments embroidered, <br/>  highly embroidered garments for my neck— <br/>   all this as plunder?’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_5_31">  <sup>31</sup>“So may all your enemies perish, Lord! <br/>   But may all who love you be like the sun <br/>   when it rises in its strength.” <br/> Then the land had peace forty years. <br/></span>
