<div class="title"><h1>38</h1><h3>The Altar of Burnt Offering </h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_38_1"> <sup>1</sup>They<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or He ; also in verses 2-9">⚓</a> built the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood, three cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 4 1/2 feet or about 1.4 meters">⚓</a> high; it was square, five cubits long and five cubits wide.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 7 1/2 feet or about 2.3 meters long and wide">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse xu_38_2"><sup>2</sup>They made a horn at each of the four corners, so that the horns and the altar were of one piece, and they overlaid the altar with bronze. </span>
<span class="verse xu_38_3"><sup>3</sup>They made all its utensils of bronze—its pots, shovels, sprinkling bowls, meat forks and firepans. </span>
<span class="verse xu_38_4"><sup>4</sup>They made a grating for the altar, a bronze network, to be under its ledge, halfway up the altar. </span>
<span class="verse xu_38_5"><sup>5</sup>They cast bronze rings to hold the poles for the four corners of the bronze grating. </span>
<span class="verse xu_38_6"><sup>6</sup>They made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze. </span>
<span class="verse xu_38_7"><sup>7</sup>They inserted the poles into the rings so they would be on the sides of the altar for carrying it. They made it hollow, out of boards. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Basin for Washing </h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_38_8"> <sup>8</sup>They made the bronze basin and its bronze stand from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Courtyard </h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_38_9"> <sup>9</sup>Next they made the courtyard. The south side was a hundred cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 150 feet or about 45 meters">⚓</a> long and had curtains of finely twisted linen, </span>
<span class="verse xu_38_10"><sup>10</sup>with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and with silver hooks and bands on the posts. </span>
<span class="verse xu_38_11"><sup>11</sup>The north side was also a hundred cubits long and had twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_38_12"> <sup>12</sup>The west end was fifty cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 75 feet or about 23 meters">⚓</a> wide and had curtains, with ten posts and ten bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts. </span>
<span class="verse xu_38_13"><sup>13</sup>The east end, toward the sunrise, was also fifty cubits wide. </span>
<span class="verse xu_38_14"><sup>14</sup>Curtains fifteen cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 22 feet or about 6.8 meters">⚓</a> long were on one side of the entrance, with three posts and three bases, </span>
<span class="verse xu_38_15"><sup>15</sup>and curtains fifteen cubits long were on the other side of the entrance to the courtyard, with three posts and three bases. </span>
<span class="verse xu_38_16"><sup>16</sup>All the curtains around the courtyard were of finely twisted linen. </span>
<span class="verse xu_38_17"><sup>17</sup>The bases for the posts were bronze. The hooks and bands on the posts were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver; so all the posts of the courtyard had silver bands. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_38_18"> <sup>18</sup>The curtain for the entrance to the courtyard was made of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer. It was twenty cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 30 feet or about 9 meters">⚓</a> long and, like the curtains of the courtyard, five cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 7 1/2 feet or about 2.3 meters">⚓</a> high, </span>

<span class="verse xu_38_20"><sup>20</sup>All the tent pegs of the tabernacle and of the surrounding courtyard were bronze. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Materials Used </h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_38_21"> <sup>21</sup>These are the amounts of the materials used for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the covenant law, which were recorded at Moses’ command by the Levites under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest. </span>
<span class="verse xu_38_22"><sup>22</sup>(Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything the Lord commanded Moses; </span>
<span class="verse xu_38_23"><sup>23</sup>with him was Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan—an engraver and designer, and an embroiderer in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen.) </span>
<span class="verse xu_38_24"><sup>24</sup>The total amount of the gold from the wave offering used for all the work on the sanctuary was 29 talents and 730 shekels,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The weight of the gold was a little over a ton or about 1 metric ton.">⚓</a> according to the sanctuary shekel. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_38_25"> <sup>25</sup>The silver obtained from those of the community who were counted in the census was 100 talents<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 3 3/4 tons or about 3.4 metric tons; also in verse 27">⚓</a> and 1,775 shekels,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 44 pounds or about 20 kilograms; also in verse 28">⚓</a> according to the sanctuary shekel— </span>
<span class="verse xu_38_26"><sup>26</sup>one beka per person, that is, half a shekel,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 1/5 ounce or about 5.7 grams">⚓</a> according to the sanctuary shekel, from everyone who had crossed over to those counted, twenty years old or more, a total of 603,550 men. </span>
<span class="verse xu_38_27"><sup>27</sup>The 100 talents of silver were used to cast the bases for the sanctuary and for the curtain—100 bases from the 100 talents, one talent for each base. </span>
<span class="verse xu_38_28"><sup>28</sup>They used the 1,775 shekels to make the hooks for the posts, to overlay the tops of the posts, and to make their bands. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_38_29"> <sup>29</sup>The bronze from the wave offering was 70 talents and 2,400 shekels.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The weight of the bronze was about 2 1/2 tons or about 2.4 metric tons.">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse xu_38_30"><sup>30</sup>They used it to make the bases for the entrance to the tent of meeting, the bronze altar with its bronze grating and all its utensils, </span>
<span class="verse xu_38_31"><sup>31</sup>the bases for the surrounding courtyard and those for its entrance and all the tent pegs for the tabernacle and those for the surrounding courtyard. <br/></span>
