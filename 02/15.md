<div class="title"><h1>15</h1><h3>The Song of Moses and Miriam </h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_15_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord: <br/>  “I will sing to the Lord, <br/>   for he is highly exalted. <br/>  Both horse and driver <br/>   he has hurled into the sea. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_2">  <sup>2</sup>“The Lord is my strength and my defense<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or song">⚓</a> ; <br/>   he has become my salvation. <br/>  He is my God, and I will praise him, <br/>   my father’s God, and I will exalt him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_3">  <sup>3</sup>The Lord is a warrior; <br/>   the Lord is his name. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_4">  <sup>4</sup>Pharaoh’s chariots and his army <br/>   he has hurled into the sea. <br/>  The best of Pharaoh’s officers <br/>   are drowned in the Red Sea.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or the Sea of Reeds ; also in verse 22">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_5">  <sup>5</sup>The deep waters have covered them; <br/>   they sank to the depths like a stone. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_6">  <sup>6</sup>Your right hand, Lord, <br/>   was majestic in power. <br/>  Your right hand, Lord, <br/>   shattered the enemy. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_7">  <sup>7</sup>“In the greatness of your majesty <br/>   you threw down those who opposed you. <br/>  You unleashed your burning anger; <br/>   it consumed them like stubble. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_8">  <sup>8</sup>By the blast of your nostrils <br/>   the waters piled up. <br/>  The surging waters stood up like a wall; <br/>   the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_9">  <sup>9</sup>The enemy boasted, <br/>   ‘I will pursue, I will overtake them. <br/>  I will divide the spoils; <br/>   I will gorge myself on them. <br/>  I will draw my sword <br/>   and my hand will destroy them.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_10">  <sup>10</sup>But you blew with your breath, <br/>   and the sea covered them. <br/>  They sank like lead <br/>   in the mighty waters. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_11">  <sup>11</sup>Who among the gods <br/>   is like you, Lord? <br/>  Who is like you— <br/>   majestic in holiness, <br/>  awesome in glory, <br/>   working wonders? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_12">  <sup>12</sup>“You stretch out your right hand, <br/>   and the earth swallows your enemies. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_13">  <sup>13</sup>In your unfailing love you will lead <br/>   the people you have redeemed. <br/>  In your strength you will guide them <br/>   to your holy dwelling. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_14">  <sup>14</sup>The nations will hear and tremble; <br/>   anguish will grip the people of Philistia. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_15">  <sup>15</sup>The chiefs of Edom will be terrified, <br/>   the leaders of Moab will be seized with trembling, <br/>  the people<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or rulers">⚓</a> of Canaan will melt away; <br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_16">   <sup>16</sup>terror and dread will fall on them. <br/>  By the power of your arm <br/>   they will be as still as a stone— <br/>  until your people pass by, Lord, <br/>   until the people you bought<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or created">⚓</a> pass by. <br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_17">  <sup>17</sup>You will bring them in and plant them <br/>   on the mountain of your inheritance— <br/>  the place, Lord, you made for your dwelling, <br/>   the sanctuary, Lord, your hands established. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_18">  <sup>18</sup>“The Lord reigns <br/>   for ever and ever.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_19"> <sup>19</sup>When Pharaoh’s horses, chariots and horsemen<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or charioteers">⚓</a> went into the sea, the Lord brought the waters of the sea back over them, but the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground. </span>
<span class="verse xu_15_20"><sup>20</sup>Then Miriam the prophet, Aaron’s sister, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women followed her, with timbrels and dancing. </span>
<span class="verse xu_15_21"><sup>21</sup>Miriam sang to them: <br/>  “Sing to the Lord, <br/>   for he is highly exalted. <br/>  Both horse and driver <br/>   he has hurled into the sea.” <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Waters of Marah and Elim </h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_15_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea and they went into the Desert of Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water. </span>
<span class="verse xu_15_23"><sup>23</sup>When they came to Marah, they could not drink its water because it was bitter. (That is why the place is called Marah.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means bitter.">⚓</a> ) </span>
<span class="verse xu_15_24"><sup>24</sup>So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, “What are we to drink?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then Moses cried out to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a piece of wood. He threw it into the water, and the water became fit to drink. <br/> There the Lord issued a ruling and instruction for them and put them to the test. </span>
<span class="verse xu_15_26"><sup>26</sup>He said, “If you listen carefully to the Lord your God and do what is right in his eyes, if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees, I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the Lord, who heals you.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_15_27"> <sup>27</sup>Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there near the water. <br/></span>
