<span class="verse gie_49_1"> <sup>1</sup>Concerning the Ammonites: <br/> This is what the Lord says: <br/>  “Has Israel no sons? <br/>   Has Israel no heir? <br/>  Why then has Molek<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or their king ; also in verse 3">⚓</a> taken possession of Gad? <br/>   Why do his people live in its towns? <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_2">  <sup>2</sup>But the days are coming,” <br/>   declares the Lord, <br/>  “when I will sound the battle cry <br/>   against Rabbah of the Ammonites; <br/>  it will become a mound of ruins, <br/>   and its surrounding villages will be set on fire. <br/>  Then Israel will drive out <br/>   those who drove her out,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">says the Lord. </aside><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_3">  <sup>3</sup>“Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is destroyed! <br/>   Cry out, you inhabitants of Rabbah! <br/>  Put on sackcloth and mourn; <br/>   rush here and there inside the walls, <br/>  for Molek will go into exile, <br/>   together with his priests and officials. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_4">  <sup>4</sup>Why do you boast of your valleys, <br/>   boast of your valleys so fruitful? <br/>  Unfaithful Daughter Ammon, <br/>   you trust in your riches and say, <br/>   ‘Who will attack me?’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_5">  <sup>5</sup>I will bring terror on you <br/>   from all those around you,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord, the Lord Almighty. </aside><br/>  “Every one of you will be driven away, <br/>   and no one will gather the fugitives. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_6">  <sup>6</sup>“Yet afterward, I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Message About Edom </h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_49_7"> <sup>7</sup>Concerning Edom: <br/> This is what the Lord Almighty says: <br/>  “Is there no longer wisdom in Teman? <br/>   Has counsel perished from the prudent? <br/>   Has their wisdom decayed? <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_8">  <sup>8</sup>Turn and flee, hide in deep caves, <br/>   you who live in Dedan, <br/>  for I will bring disaster on Esau <br/>   at the time when I punish him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_9">  <sup>9</sup>If grape pickers came to you, <br/>   would they not leave a few grapes? <br/>  If thieves came during the night, <br/>   would they not steal only as much as they wanted? <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_10">  <sup>10</sup>But I will strip Esau bare; <br/>   I will uncover his hiding places, <br/>   so that he cannot conceal himself. <br/>  His armed men are destroyed, <br/>   also his allies and neighbors, <br/>   so there is no one to say, <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_11">  <sup>11</sup>‘Leave your fatherless children; I will keep them alive. <br/>   Your widows too can depend on me.’ ” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_12"> <sup>12</sup>This is what the Lord says: “If those who do not deserve to drink the cup must drink it, why should you go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, but must drink it. </span>
<span class="verse gie_49_13"><sup>13</sup>I swear by myself,” declares the Lord, “that Bozrah will become a ruin and a curse,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, its name will be used in cursing (see 29:22); or, others will see that it is cursed.">⚓</a> an object of horror and reproach; and all its towns will be in ruins forever.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_14">  <sup>14</sup>I have heard a message from the Lord; <br/>   an envoy was sent to the nations to say, <br/>  “Assemble yourselves to attack it! <br/>   Rise up for battle!” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_15">  <sup>15</sup>“Now I will make you small among the nations, <br/>   despised by mankind. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_16">  <sup>16</sup>The terror you inspire <br/>   and the pride of your heart have deceived you, <br/>  you who live in the clefts of the rocks, <br/>   who occupy the heights of the hill. <br/>  Though you build your nest as high as the eagle’s, <br/>   from there I will bring you down,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_17">  <sup>17</sup>“Edom will become an object of horror; <br/>   all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff <br/>   because of all its wounds. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_18">  <sup>18</sup>As Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown, <br/>   along with their neighboring towns,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">says the Lord, </aside><br/>  “so no one will live there; <br/>   no people will dwell in it. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_19">  <sup>19</sup>“Like a lion coming up from Jordan’s thickets <br/>   to a rich pastureland, <br/>  I will chase Edom from its land in an instant. <br/>   Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? <br/>  Who is like me and who can challenge me? <br/>   And what shepherd can stand against me?” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_20">  <sup>20</sup>Therefore, hear what the Lord has planned against Edom, <br/>   what he has purposed against those who live in Teman: <br/>  The young of the flock will be dragged away; <br/>   their pasture will be appalled at their fate. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_21">  <sup>21</sup>At the sound of their fall the earth will tremble; <br/>   their cry will resound to the Red Sea.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or the Sea of Reeds">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_22">  <sup>22</sup>Look! An eagle will soar and swoop down, <br/>   spreading its wings over Bozrah. <br/>  In that day the hearts of Edom’s warriors <br/>   will be like the heart of a woman in labor. <br/></span>

<span class="verse gie_49_24">  <sup>24</sup>Damascus has become feeble, <br/>   she has turned to flee <br/>   and panic has gripped her; <br/>  anguish and pain have seized her, <br/>   pain like that of a woman in labor. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_25">  <sup>25</sup>Why has the city of renown not been abandoned, <br/>   the town in which I delight? <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_26">  <sup>26</sup>Surely, her young men will fall in the streets; <br/>   all her soldiers will be silenced in that day,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord Almighty. </aside><br/></span>

<span class="verse gie_49_30">  <sup>30</sup>“Flee quickly away! <br/>   Stay in deep caves, you who live in Hazor,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/>  “Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has plotted against you; <br/>   he has devised a plan against you. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_31">  <sup>31</sup>“Arise and attack a nation at ease, <br/>   which lives in confidence,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord, </aside><br/>  “a nation that has neither gates nor bars; <br/>   its people live far from danger. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_49_32">  <sup>32</sup>Their camels will become plunder, <br/>   and their large herds will be spoils of war. <br/>  I will scatter to the winds those who are in distant places<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or who clip the hair by their foreheads">⚓</a><br/>   and will bring disaster on them from every side,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/></span>
