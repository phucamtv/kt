<div class="title"><h1>45</h1><h3>A Message to Baruch </h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_45_1"> <sup>1</sup>When Baruch son of Neriah wrote on a scroll the words Jeremiah the prophet dictated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, Jeremiah said this to Baruch: </span>
<span class="verse gie_45_2"><sup>2</sup>“This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch: </span>
<span class="verse gie_45_3"><sup>3</sup>You said, ‘Woe to me! The Lord has added sorrow to my pain; I am worn out with groaning and find no rest.’ </span>
<span class="verse gie_45_4"><sup>4</sup>But the Lord has told me to say to you, ‘This is what the Lord says: I will overthrow what I have built and uproot what I have planted, throughout the earth. </span>
<span class="verse gie_45_5"><sup>5</sup>Should you then seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them. For I will bring disaster on all people, declares the Lord, but wherever you go I will let you escape with your life.’ ” <br/></span>
