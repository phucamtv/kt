<span class="verse gie_48_1"> <sup>1</sup>Concerning Moab: <br/> This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: <br/>  “Woe to Nebo, for it will be ruined. <br/>   Kiriathaim will be disgraced and captured; <br/>   the stronghold<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or captured; / Misgab">⚓</a> will be disgraced and shattered. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_2">  <sup>2</sup>Moab will be praised no more; <br/>   in Heshbon<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew for Heshbon sounds like the Hebrew for plot .">⚓</a> people will plot her downfall: <br/>   ‘Come, let us put an end to that nation.’ <br/>  You, the people of Madmen,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The name of the Moabite town Madmen sounds like the Hebrew for be silenced.">⚓</a> will also be silenced; <br/>   the sword will pursue you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_3">  <sup>3</sup>Cries of anguish arise from Horonaim, <br/>   cries of great havoc and destruction. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_4">  <sup>4</sup>Moab will be broken; <br/>   her little ones will cry out.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew; Septuagint / proclaim it to Zoar">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_5">  <sup>5</sup>They go up the hill to Luhith, <br/>   weeping bitterly as they go; <br/>  on the road down to Horonaim <br/>   anguished cries over the destruction are heard. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_6">  <sup>6</sup>Flee! Run for your lives; <br/>   become like a bush<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or like Aroer">⚓</a> in the desert. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_7">  <sup>7</sup>Since you trust in your deeds and riches, <br/>   you too will be taken captive, <br/>  and Chemosh will go into exile, <br/>   together with his priests and officials. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_8">  <sup>8</sup>The destroyer will come against every town, <br/>   and not a town will escape. <br/>  The valley will be ruined <br/>   and the plateau destroyed, <br/>   because the Lord has spoken. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_9">  <sup>9</sup>Put salt on Moab, <br/>   for she will be laid waste<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Give wings to Moab, / for she will fly away">⚓</a> ; <br/>  her towns will become desolate, <br/>   with no one to live in them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_10">  <sup>10</sup>“A curse on anyone who is lax in doing the Lord’s work! <br/>   A curse on anyone who keeps their sword from bloodshed! <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_11">  <sup>11</sup>“Moab has been at rest from youth, <br/>   like wine left on its dregs, <br/>  not poured from one jar to another— <br/>   she has not gone into exile. <br/>  So she tastes as she did, <br/>   and her aroma is unchanged. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_12">  <sup>12</sup>But days are coming,” <br/>   declares the Lord, <br/>  “when I will send men who pour from pitchers, <br/>   and they will pour her out; <br/>  they will empty her pitchers <br/>   and smash her jars. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_13">  <sup>13</sup>Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, <br/>   as Israel was ashamed <br/>   when they trusted in Bethel. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_14">  <sup>14</sup>“How can you say, ‘We are warriors, <br/>   men valiant in battle’? <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_15">  <sup>15</sup>Moab will be destroyed and her towns invaded; <br/>   her finest young men will go down in the slaughter,” <br/>   declares the King, whose name is the Lord Almighty. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_16">  <sup>16</sup>“The fall of Moab is at hand; <br/>   her calamity will come quickly. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_17">  <sup>17</sup>Mourn for her, all who live around her, <br/>   all who know her fame; <br/>  say, ‘How broken is the mighty scepter, <br/>   how broken the glorious staff!’ <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_18">  <sup>18</sup>“Come down from your glory <br/>   and sit on the parched ground, <br/>   you inhabitants of Daughter Dibon, <br/>  for the one who destroys Moab <br/>   will come up against you <br/>   and ruin your fortified cities. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_19">  <sup>19</sup>Stand by the road and watch, <br/>   you who live in Aroer. <br/>  Ask the man fleeing and the woman escaping, <br/>   ask them, ‘What has happened?’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_20">  <sup>20</sup>Moab is disgraced, for she is shattered. <br/>   Wail and cry out! <br/>  Announce by the Arnon <br/>   that Moab is destroyed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_21">  <sup>21</sup>Judgment has come to the plateau— <br/>   to Holon, Jahzah and Mephaath, <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_22">   <sup>22</sup>to Dibon, Nebo and Beth Diblathaim, <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_23">   <sup>23</sup>to Kiriathaim, Beth Gamul and Beth Meon, <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_24">   <sup>24</sup>to Kerioth and Bozrah— <br/>   to all the towns of Moab, far and near. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_25">  <sup>25</sup>Moab’s horn<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="here symbolizes strength.">⚓</a> is cut off; <br/>   her arm is broken,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_26">  <sup>26</sup>“Make her drunk, <br/>   for she has defied the Lord. <br/>  Let Moab wallow in her vomit; <br/>   let her be an object of ridicule. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_27">  <sup>27</sup>Was not Israel the object of your ridicule? <br/>   Was she caught among thieves, <br/>  that you shake your head in scorn <br/>   whenever you speak of her? <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_28">  <sup>28</sup>Abandon your towns and dwell among the rocks, <br/>   you who live in Moab. <br/>  Be like a dove that makes its nest <br/>   at the mouth of a cave. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_29">  <sup>29</sup>“We have heard of Moab’s pride— <br/>   how great is her arrogance!— <br/>  of her insolence, her pride, her conceit <br/>   and the haughtiness of her heart. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_30">  <sup>30</sup>I know her insolence but it is futile,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord, </aside><br/>   “and her boasts accomplish nothing. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_31">  <sup>31</sup>Therefore I wail over Moab, <br/>   for all Moab I cry out, <br/>   I moan for the people of Kir Hareseth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_32">  <sup>32</sup>I weep for you, as Jazer weeps, <br/>   you vines of Sibmah. <br/>  Your branches spread as far as the sea<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Probably the Dead Sea">⚓</a> ; <br/>   they reached as far as<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Two Hebrew manuscripts and Septuagint; most Hebrew manuscripts as far as the Sea of">⚓</a> Jazer. <br/>  The destroyer has fallen <br/>   on your ripened fruit and grapes. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_33">  <sup>33</sup>Joy and gladness are gone <br/>   from the orchards and fields of Moab. <br/>  I have stopped the flow of wine from the presses; <br/>   no one treads them with shouts of joy. <br/>  Although there are shouts, <br/>   they are not shouts of joy. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_34">  <sup>34</sup>“The sound of their cry rises <br/>   from Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz, <br/>  from Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah, <br/>   for even the waters of Nimrim are dried up. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_35">  <sup>35</sup>In Moab I will put an end <br/>   to those who make offerings on the high places <br/>   and burn incense to their gods,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_36">  <sup>36</sup>“So my heart laments for Moab like the music of a pipe; <br/>   it laments like a pipe for the people of Kir Hareseth. <br/>   The wealth they acquired is gone. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_37">  <sup>37</sup>Every head is shaved <br/>   and every beard cut off; <br/>  every hand is slashed <br/>   and every waist is covered with sackcloth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_38">  <sup>38</sup>On all the roofs in Moab <br/>   and in the public squares <br/>  there is nothing but mourning, <br/>   for I have broken Moab <br/>   like a jar that no one wants,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_39">  <sup>39</sup>“How shattered she is! How they wail! <br/>   How Moab turns her back in shame! <br/>  Moab has become an object of ridicule, <br/>   an object of horror to all those around her.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_40"> <sup>40</sup>This is what the Lord says: <br/>  “Look! An eagle is swooping down, <br/>   spreading its wings over Moab. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_41">  <sup>41</sup>Kerioth<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or The cities">⚓</a> will be captured <br/>   and the strongholds taken. <br/>  In that day the hearts of Moab’s warriors <br/>   will be like the heart of a woman in labor. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_42">  <sup>42</sup>Moab will be destroyed as a nation <br/>   because she defied the Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_43">  <sup>43</sup>Terror and pit and snare await you, <br/>   you people of Moab,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_44">  <sup>44</sup>“Whoever flees from the terror <br/>   will fall into a pit, <br/>  whoever climbs out of the pit <br/>   will be caught in a snare; <br/>  for I will bring on Moab <br/>   the year of her punishment,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_45">  <sup>45</sup>“In the shadow of Heshbon <br/>   the fugitives stand helpless, <br/>  for a fire has gone out from Heshbon, <br/>   a blaze from the midst of Sihon; <br/>  it burns the foreheads of Moab, <br/>   the skulls of the noisy boasters. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_46">  <sup>46</sup>Woe to you, Moab! <br/>   The people of Chemosh are destroyed; <br/>  your sons are taken into exile <br/>   and your daughters into captivity. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_48_47">  <sup>47</sup>“Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab <br/>   in days to come,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/> Here ends the judgment on Moab. <br/></span>
