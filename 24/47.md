<div class="title"><h1>47</h1><h3>A Message About the Philistines </h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_47_1"> <sup>1</sup>This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines before Pharaoh attacked Gaza: <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_47_2"> <sup>2</sup>This is what the Lord says: <br/>  “See how the waters are rising in the north; <br/>   they will become an overflowing torrent. <br/>  They will overflow the land and everything in it, <br/>   the towns and those who live in them. <br/>  The people will cry out; <br/>   all who dwell in the land will wail <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_47_3">  <sup>3</sup>at the sound of the hooves of galloping steeds, <br/>   at the noise of enemy chariots <br/>   and the rumble of their wheels. <br/>  Parents will not turn to help their children; <br/>   their hands will hang limp. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_47_4">  <sup>4</sup>For the day has come <br/>   to destroy all the Philistines <br/>  and to remove all survivors <br/>   who could help Tyre and Sidon. <br/>  The Lord is about to destroy the Philistines, <br/>   the remnant from the coasts of Caphtor.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, Crete">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_47_5">  <sup>5</sup>Gaza will shave her head in mourning; <br/>   Ashkelon will be silenced. <br/>  You remnant on the plain, <br/>   how long will you cut yourselves? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_47_6">  <sup>6</sup>“ ‘Alas, sword of the Lord, <br/>   how long till you rest? <br/>  Return to your sheath; <br/>   cease and be still.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_47_7">  <sup>7</sup>But how can it rest <br/>   when the Lord has commanded it, <br/>  when he has ordered it <br/>   to attack Ashkelon and the coast?” <br/></span>
