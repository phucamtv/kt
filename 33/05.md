<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>A Promised Ruler From Bethlehem </h3></div>
<span class="verse mi_5_1">  <sup>1</sup>Marshal your troops now, city of troops, <br/>   for a siege is laid against us. <br/>  They will strike Israel’s ruler <br/>   on the cheek with a rod. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_5_2">  <sup>2</sup>“But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, <br/>   though you are small among the clans<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or rulers">⚓</a> of Judah, <br/>  out of you will come for me <br/>   one who will be ruler over Israel, <br/>  whose origins are from of old, <br/>   from ancient times.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_5_3">  <sup>3</sup>Therefore Israel will be abandoned <br/>   until the time when she who is in labor bears a son, <br/>  and the rest of his brothers return <br/>   to join the Israelites. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_5_4">  <sup>4</sup>He will stand and shepherd his flock <br/>   in the strength of the Lord, <br/>   in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God. <br/>  And they will live securely, for then his greatness <br/>   will reach to the ends of the earth. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_5_5">  <sup>5</sup>And he will be our peace <br/>   when the Assyrians invade our land <br/>   and march through our fortresses. <br/>  We will raise against them seven shepherds, <br/>   even eight commanders, <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_5_6">  <sup>6</sup>who will rule<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or crush">⚓</a> the land of Assyria with the sword, <br/>   the land of Nimrod with drawn sword.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Nimrod in its gates">⚓</a><br/>  He will deliver us from the Assyrians <br/>   when they invade our land <br/>   and march across our borders. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_5_7">  <sup>7</sup>The remnant of Jacob will be <br/>   in the midst of many peoples <br/>  like dew from the Lord, <br/>   like showers on the grass, <br/>  which do not wait for anyone <br/>   or depend on man. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_5_8">  <sup>8</sup>The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, <br/>   in the midst of many peoples, <br/>  like a lion among the beasts of the forest, <br/>   like a young lion among flocks of sheep, <br/>  which mauls and mangles as it goes, <br/>   and no one can rescue. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_5_9">  <sup>9</sup>Your hand will be lifted up in triumph over your enemies, <br/>   and all your foes will be destroyed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_5_10"> <sup>10</sup>“In that day,” declares the Lord, <br/>  “I will destroy your horses from among you <br/>   and demolish your chariots. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_5_11">  <sup>11</sup>I will destroy the cities of your land <br/>   and tear down all your strongholds. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_5_12">  <sup>12</sup>I will destroy your witchcraft <br/>   and you will no longer cast spells. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_5_13">  <sup>13</sup>I will destroy your idols <br/>   and your sacred stones from among you; <br/>  you will no longer bow down <br/>   to the work of your hands. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_5_14">  <sup>14</sup>I will uproot from among you your Asherah poles<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, wooden symbols of the goddess Asherah">⚓</a><br/>   when I demolish your cities. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_5_15">  <sup>15</sup>I will take vengeance in anger and wrath <br/>   on the nations that have not obeyed me.” <br/></span>
