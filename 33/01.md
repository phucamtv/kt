<div class="title"><h1>1</h1></div>
<span class="verse mi_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>The word of the Lord that came to Micah of Moresheth during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah—the vision he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_1_2">  <sup>2</sup>Hear, you peoples, all of you, <br/>   listen, earth and all who live in it, <br/>  that the Sovereign Lord may bear witness against you, <br/>   the Lord from his holy temple. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Judgment Against Samaria and Jerusalem </h3></div>
<span class="verse mi_1_3">  <sup>3</sup>Look! The Lord is coming from his dwelling place; <br/>   he comes down and treads on the heights of the earth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_1_4">  <sup>4</sup>The mountains melt beneath him <br/>   and the valleys split apart, <br/>  like wax before the fire, <br/>   like water rushing down a slope. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_1_5">  <sup>5</sup>All this is because of Jacob’s transgression, <br/>   because of the sins of the people of Israel. <br/>  What is Jacob’s transgression? <br/>   Is it not Samaria? <br/>  What is Judah’s high place? <br/>   Is it not Jerusalem? <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_1_6">  <sup>6</sup>“Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of rubble, <br/>   a place for planting vineyards. <br/>  I will pour her stones into the valley <br/>   and lay bare her foundations. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_1_7">  <sup>7</sup>All her idols will be broken to pieces; <br/>   all her temple gifts will be burned with fire; <br/>   I will destroy all her images. <br/>  Since she gathered her gifts from the wages of prostitutes, <br/>   as the wages of prostitutes they will again be used.” <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Weeping and Mourning </h3></div>
<span class="verse mi_1_8">  <sup>8</sup>Because of this I will weep and wail; <br/>   I will go about barefoot and naked. <br/>  I will howl like a jackal <br/>   and moan like an owl. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_1_9">  <sup>9</sup>For Samaria’s plague is incurable; <br/>   it has spread to Judah. <br/>  It has reached the very gate of my people, <br/>   even to Jerusalem itself. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_1_10">  <sup>10</sup>Tell it not in Gath<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="sounds like the Hebrew for tell.">⚓</a> ; <br/>   weep not at all. <br/>  In Beth Ophrah<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means house of dust.">⚓</a><br/>   roll in the dust. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_1_11">  <sup>11</sup>Pass by naked and in shame, <br/>   you who live in Shaphir.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means pleasant.">⚓</a><br/>  Those who live in Zaanan<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="sounds like the Hebrew for come out.">⚓</a><br/>   will not come out. <br/>  Beth Ezel is in mourning; <br/>   it no longer protects you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_1_12">  <sup>12</sup>Those who live in Maroth<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="sounds like the Hebrew for bitter.">⚓</a> writhe in pain, <br/>   waiting for relief, <br/>  because disaster has come from the Lord, <br/>   even to the gate of Jerusalem. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_1_13">  <sup>13</sup>You who live in Lachish, <br/>   harness fast horses to the chariot. <br/>  You are where the sin of Daughter Zion began, <br/>   for the transgressions of Israel were found in you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_1_14">  <sup>14</sup>Therefore you will give parting gifts <br/>   to Moresheth Gath. <br/>  The town of Akzib<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means deception.">⚓</a> will prove deceptive <br/>   to the kings of Israel. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_1_15">  <sup>15</sup>I will bring a conqueror against you <br/>   who live in Mareshah.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="sounds like the Hebrew for conqueror.">⚓</a><br/>  The nobles of Israel <br/>   will flee to Adullam. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_1_16">  <sup>16</sup>Shave your head in mourning <br/>   for the children in whom you delight; <br/>  make yourself as bald as the vulture, <br/>   for they will go from you into exile. <br/></span>
