<span class="verse mi_6_5">  <sup>5</sup>My people, remember <br/>   what Balak king of Moab plotted <br/>   and what Balaam son of Beor answered. <br/>  Remember your journey from Shittim to Gilgal, <br/>   that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_6_6">  <sup>6</sup>With what shall I come before the Lord<br/>   and bow down before the exalted God? <br/>  Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, <br/>   with calves a year old? <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_6_7">  <sup>7</sup>Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, <br/>   with ten thousand rivers of olive oil? <br/>  Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression, <br/>   the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_6_8">  <sup>8</sup>He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. <br/>   And what does the Lord require of you? <br/>  To act justly and to love mercy <br/>   and to walk humbly<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or prudently">⚓</a> with your God. <br/></span>

<span class="verse mi_6_10">  <sup>10</sup>Am I still to forget your ill-gotten treasures, you wicked house, <br/>   and the short ephah,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="An ephah was a dry measure.">⚓</a> which is accursed? <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_6_11">  <sup>11</sup>Shall I acquit someone with dishonest scales, <br/>   with a bag of false weights? <br/></span>
<span class="verse mi_6_12">  <sup>12</sup>Your rich people are violent; <br/>   your inhabitants are liars <br/>   and their tongues speak deceitfully. <br/></span>
