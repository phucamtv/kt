<div class="title"><h1>8</h1></div>
<span class="verse gi_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_2"> <sup>2</sup>At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. </span>
<span class="verse gi_8_3"><sup>3</sup>The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group </span>
<span class="verse gi_8_4"><sup>4</sup>and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. </span>
<span class="verse gi_8_5"><sup>5</sup>In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?” </span>
<span class="verse gi_8_6"><sup>6</sup>They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. <br/> But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. </span>
<span class="verse gi_8_7"><sup>7</sup>When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” </span>
<span class="verse gi_8_8"><sup>8</sup>Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_9"> <sup>9</sup>At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. </span>
<span class="verse gi_8_10"><sup>10</sup>Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_11"> <sup>11</sup>“No one, sir,” she said. <br/> “Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go now and leave your life of sin.” <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Dispute Over Jesus’ Testimony </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_8_12"> <sup>12</sup>When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, <font color="red">“I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_13"> <sup>13</sup>The Pharisees challenged him, “Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_14"> <sup>14</sup>Jesus answered, <font color="red">“Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">But if I do judge, my decisions are true, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then they asked him, “Where is your father?” <br/> <font color="red">“You do not know me or my Father,”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="red">“If you knew me, you would know my Father also.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_20"><sup>20</sup>He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Dispute Over Who Jesus Is </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_8_21"> <sup>21</sup>Once more Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_22"> <sup>22</sup>This made the Jews ask, “Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, <font color="red">‘Where I go, you cannot come’</font>?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_23"> <sup>23</sup>But he continued, <font color="red">“You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am he, you will indeed die in your sins.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_25"> <sup>25</sup>“Who are you?” they asked. <br/> <font color="red">“Just what I have been telling you from the beginning,”</font> Jesus replied. </span>
<span class="verse gi_8_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">“I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is trustworthy, and what I have heard from him I tell the world.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_27"> <sup>27</sup>They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father. </span>
<span class="verse gi_8_28"><sup>28</sup>So Jesus said, <font color="red">“When you have lifted up</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek for lifted up also means exalted .">⚓</a><font color="red">the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_30"><sup>30</sup>Even as he spoke, many believed in him. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Dispute Over Whose Children Jesus’ Opponents Are </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_8_31"> <sup>31</sup>To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, <font color="red">“If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_33"> <sup>33</sup>They answered him, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_34"> <sup>34</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_36"><sup>36</sup><font color="red">So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_37"><sup>37</sup><font color="red">I know that you are Abraham’s descendants. Yet you are looking for a way to kill me, because you have no room for my word.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_38"><sup>38</sup><font color="red">I am telling you what I have seen in the Father’s presence, and you are doing what you have heard from your father.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or presence. Therefore do what you have heard from the Father.">⚓</a><font color="red">”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_39"> <sup>39</sup>“Abraham is our father,” they answered. <br/> <font color="red">“If you were Abraham’s children,”</font> said Jesus, <font color="red">“then you would</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some early manuscripts “If you are Abraham’s children,” said Jesus, “then">⚓</a><font color="red">do what Abraham did.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_40"><sup>40</sup><font color="red">As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_41"><sup>41</sup><font color="red">You are doing the works of your own father.”</font><br/> “We are not illegitimate children,” they protested. “The only Father we have is God himself.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_42"> <sup>42</sup>Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_43"><sup>43</sup><font color="red">Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_44"><sup>44</sup><font color="red">You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_45"><sup>45</sup><font color="red">Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_46"><sup>46</sup><font color="red">Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don’t you believe me?</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_47"><sup>47</sup><font color="red">Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus’ Claims About Himself </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_8_48"> <sup>48</sup>The Jews answered him, “Aren’t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_49"> <sup>49</sup><font color="red">“I am not possessed by a demon,”</font> said Jesus, <font color="red">“but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_50"><sup>50</sup><font color="red">I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_51"><sup>51</sup><font color="red">Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_52"> <sup>52</sup>At this they exclaimed, “Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death. </span>
<span class="verse gi_8_53"><sup>53</sup>Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_54"> <sup>54</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_55"><sup>55</sup><font color="red">Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and obey his word.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_56"><sup>56</sup><font color="red">Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_57"> <sup>57</sup>“You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to him, “and you have seen Abraham!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_58"> <sup>58</sup><font color="red">“Very truly I tell you,”</font> Jesus answered, <font color="red">“before Abraham was born, I am!”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_8_59"><sup>59</sup>At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds. <br/></span>
