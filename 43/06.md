<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias), </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_2"><sup>2</sup>and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the signs he had performed by healing the sick. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_3"><sup>3</sup>Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_4"><sup>4</sup>The Jewish Passover Festival was near. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_5"> <sup>5</sup>When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, <font color="red">“Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_6"><sup>6</sup>He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_7"> <sup>7</sup>Philip answered him, “It would take more than half a year’s wages<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Greek take two hundred denarii">⚓</a> to buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_8"> <sup>8</sup>Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, spoke up, </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_9"><sup>9</sup>“Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_10"> <sup>10</sup>Jesus said, <font color="red">“Have the people sit down.”</font> There was plenty of grass in that place, and they sat down (about five thousand men were there). </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_11"><sup>11</sup>Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_12"> <sup>12</sup>When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, <font color="red">“Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_13"><sup>13</sup>So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_14"> <sup>14</sup>After the people saw the sign Jesus performed, they began to say, “Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.” </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_15"><sup>15</sup>Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Walks on the Water </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_6_16"> <sup>16</sup>When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_17"><sup>17</sup>where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_18"><sup>18</sup>A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_19"><sup>19</sup>When they had rowed about three or four miles,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or about 5 or 6 kilometers">⚓</a> they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were frightened. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_20"><sup>20</sup>But he said to them, <font color="red">“It is I; don’t be afraid.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_21"><sup>21</sup>Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_22"> <sup>22</sup>The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_23"><sup>23</sup>Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_24"><sup>24</sup>Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus the Bread of Life </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_6_25"> <sup>25</sup>When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_26"> <sup>26</sup>Jesus answered, <font color="red">“Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_28"> <sup>28</sup>Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_29"> <sup>29</sup>Jesus answered, <font color="red">“The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_30"> <sup>30</sup>So they asked him, “What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_31"><sup>31</sup>Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Exodus 16:4; Neh. 9:15; Psalm 78:24,25">⚓</a> ” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_32"> <sup>32</sup>Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_33"><sup>33</sup><font color="red">For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_34"> <sup>34</sup>“Sir,” they said, “always give us this bread.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_35"> <sup>35</sup>Then Jesus declared, <font color="red">“I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_36"><sup>36</sup><font color="red">But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_37"><sup>37</sup><font color="red">All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_38"><sup>38</sup><font color="red">For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_39"><sup>39</sup><font color="red">And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_40"><sup>40</sup><font color="red">For my Father’s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_41"> <sup>41</sup>At this the Jews there began to grumble about him because he said, <font color="red">“I am the bread that came down from heaven.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_42"><sup>42</sup>They said, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, <font color="red">‘I came down from heaven’</font>?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_43"> <sup>43</sup><font color="red">“Stop grumbling among yourselves,”</font> Jesus answered. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_44"><sup>44</sup><font color="red">“No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise them up at the last day.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_45"><sup>45</sup><font color="red">It is written in the Prophets: ‘They will all be taught by God.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 54:13">⚓</a><font color="red">Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_46"><sup>46</sup><font color="red">No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_47"><sup>47</sup><font color="red">Very truly I tell you, the one who believes has eternal life.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_48"><sup>48</sup><font color="red">I am the bread of life.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_49"><sup>49</sup><font color="red">Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_50"><sup>50</sup><font color="red">But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_51"><sup>51</sup><font color="red">I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_52"> <sup>52</sup>Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_53"> <sup>53</sup>Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_54"><sup>54</sup><font color="red">Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_55"><sup>55</sup><font color="red">For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_56"><sup>56</sup><font color="red">Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_57"><sup>57</sup><font color="red">Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_58"><sup>58</sup><font color="red">This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_59"><sup>59</sup>He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Many Disciples Desert Jesus </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_6_60"> <sup>60</sup>On hearing it, many of his disciples said, “This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_61"> <sup>61</sup>Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Does this offend you?</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_62"><sup>62</sup><font color="red">Then what if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before!</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_63"><sup>63</sup><font color="red">The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or are Spirit ; or are spirit">⚓</a><font color="red">and life.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_64"><sup>64</sup><font color="red">Yet there are some of you who do not believe.”</font> For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_65"><sup>65</sup>He went on to say, <font color="red">“This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled them.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_66"> <sup>66</sup>From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_67"> <sup>67</sup><font color="red">“You do not want to leave too, do you?”</font> Jesus asked the Twelve. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_68"> <sup>68</sup>Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_69"><sup>69</sup>We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_70"> <sup>70</sup>Then Jesus replied, <font color="red">“Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_71"><sup>71</sup>(He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.) <br/></span>
