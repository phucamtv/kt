<div class="title"><h1>9</h1><h3>Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth. </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_2"><sup>2</sup>His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_3"> <sup>3</sup><font color="red">“Neither this man nor his parents sinned,”</font> said Jesus, <font color="red">“but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">As long as it is day, we must do the works of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_6"> <sup>6</sup>After saying this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man’s eyes. </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">“Go,”</font> he told him, <font color="red">“wash in the Pool of Siloam”</font> (this word means “Sent”). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_8"> <sup>8</sup>His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, “Isn’t this the same man who used to sit and beg?” </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_9"><sup>9</sup>Some claimed that he was. <br/> Others said, “No, he only looks like him.” <br/> But he himself insisted, “I am the man.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_10"> <sup>10</sup>“How then were your eyes opened?” they asked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_11"> <sup>11</sup>He replied, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_12"> <sup>12</sup>“Where is this man?” they asked him. <br/> “I don’t know,” he said. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Pharisees Investigate the Healing </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_9_13"> <sup>13</sup>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind. </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_14"><sup>14</sup>Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man’s eyes was a Sabbath. </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_15"><sup>15</sup>Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. “He put mud on my eyes,” the man replied, “and I washed, and now I see.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_16"> <sup>16</sup>Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.” <br/> But others asked, “How can a sinner perform such signs?” So they were divided. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then they turned again to the blind man, “What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened.” <br/> The man replied, “He is a prophet.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_18"> <sup>18</sup>They still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man’s parents. </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_19"><sup>19</sup>“Is this your son?” they asked. “Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_20"> <sup>20</sup>“We know he is our son,” the parents answered, “and we know he was born blind. </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_21"><sup>21</sup>But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.” </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_22"><sup>22</sup>His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who already had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue. </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_23"><sup>23</sup>That was why his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_24"> <sup>24</sup>A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. “Give glory to God by telling the truth,” they said. “We know this man is a sinner.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_25"> <sup>25</sup>He replied, “Whether he is a sinner or not, I don’t know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_26"> <sup>26</sup>Then they asked him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_27"> <sup>27</sup>He answered, “I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_28"> <sup>28</sup>Then they hurled insults at him and said, “You are this fellow’s disciple! We are disciples of Moses! </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_29"><sup>29</sup>We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don’t even know where he comes from.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_30"> <sup>30</sup>The man answered, “Now that is remarkable! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_31"><sup>31</sup>We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly person who does his will. </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_32"><sup>32</sup>Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_33"><sup>33</sup>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_34"> <sup>34</sup>To this they replied, “You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!” And they threw him out. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Spiritual Blindness </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_9_35"> <sup>35</sup>Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, <font color="red">“Do you believe in the Son of Man?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_36"> <sup>36</sup>“Who is he, sir?” the man asked. “Tell me so that I may believe in him.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_37"> <sup>37</sup>Jesus said, <font color="red">“You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_38"> <sup>38</sup>Then the man said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_39"> <sup>39</sup>Jesus said,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some early manuscripts do not have Then the man said … 39Jesus said,">⚓</a><font color="red">“For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_40"> <sup>40</sup>Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, “What? Are we blind too?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_41"> <sup>41</sup>Jesus said, <font color="red">“If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.</font><br/></span>
