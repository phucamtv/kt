<div class="title"><h1>1</h1><h3>The Word Became Flesh </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_2"><sup>2</sup>He was with God in the beginning. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_3"><sup>3</sup>Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_4"><sup>4</sup>In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_5"><sup>5</sup>The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or understood">⚓</a> it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_6"> <sup>6</sup>There was a man sent from God whose name was John. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_7"><sup>7</sup>He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_8"><sup>8</sup>He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_9"> <sup>9</sup>The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_10"><sup>10</sup>He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_11"><sup>11</sup>He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_12"><sup>12</sup>Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God— </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_13"><sup>13</sup>children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_14"> <sup>14</sup>The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_15"> <sup>15</sup>(John testified concerning him. He cried out, saying, “This is the one I spoke about when I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’ ”) </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_16"><sup>16</sup>Out of his fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_17"><sup>17</sup>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_18"><sup>18</sup>No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts but the only Son, who">⚓</a> is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>John the Baptist Denies Being the Messiah </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_1_19"> <sup>19</sup>Now this was John’s testimony when the Jewish leaders<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek term traditionally translated the Jews (hoi Ioudaioi ) refers here and elsewhere in John’s Gospel to those Jewish leaders who opposed Jesus; also in 5:10, 15, 16; 7:1, 11, 13; 9:22; 18:14, 28, 36; 19:7, 12, 31, 38.">⚓</a> in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_20"><sup>20</sup>He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, “I am not the Messiah.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_21"> <sup>21</sup>They asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” <br/> He said, “I am not.” <br/> “Are you the Prophet?” <br/> He answered, “No.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_22"> <sup>22</sup>Finally they said, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_23"> <sup>23</sup>John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, “I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way for the Lord.’ ”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 40:3">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_24"> <sup>24</sup>Now the Pharisees who had been sent </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_25"><sup>25</sup>questioned him, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_26"> <sup>26</sup>“I baptize with<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or in ; also in verses 31 and 33 (twice)">⚓</a> water,” John replied, “but among you stands one you do not know. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_27"><sup>27</sup>He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_28"> <sup>28</sup>This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>John Testifies About Jesus </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_1_29"> <sup>29</sup>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_30"><sup>30</sup>This is the one I meant when I said, ‘A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’ </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_31"><sup>31</sup>I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_32"> <sup>32</sup>Then John gave this testimony: “I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_33"><sup>33</sup>And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_34"><sup>34</sup>I have seen and I testify that this is God’s Chosen One.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="See Isaiah 42:1; many manuscripts is the Son of God .">⚓</a><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>John’s Disciples Follow Jesus </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_1_35"> <sup>35</sup>The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_36"><sup>36</sup>When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_37"> <sup>37</sup>When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_38"><sup>38</sup>Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, <font color="red">“What do you want?”</font><br/> They said, “Rabbi” (which means “Teacher”), “where are you staying?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_39"> <sup>39</sup><font color="red">“Come,”</font> he replied, <font color="red">“and you will see.”</font><br/> So they went and saw where he was staying, and they spent that day with him. It was about four in the afternoon. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_40"> <sup>40</sup>Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_41"><sup>41</sup>The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, “We have found the Messiah” (that is, the Christ). </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_42"><sup>42</sup>And he brought him to Jesus. <br/> Jesus looked at him and said, <font color="red">“You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas”</font> (which, when translated, is Peter<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Aramaic) and Peter (Greek) both mean rock .">⚓</a> ). <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Calls Philip and Nathanael </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_1_43"> <sup>43</sup>The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, <font color="red">“Follow me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_44"> <sup>44</sup>Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_45"><sup>45</sup>Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_46"> <sup>46</sup>“Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?” Nathanael asked. <br/> “Come and see,” said Philip. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_47"> <sup>47</sup>When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, <font color="red">“Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_48"> <sup>48</sup>“How do you know me?” Nathanael asked. <br/> Jesus answered, <font color="red">“I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_49"> <sup>49</sup>Then Nathanael declared, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king of Israel.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_50"> <sup>50</sup>Jesus said, <font color="red">“You believe</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Do you believe … ?">⚓</a><font color="red">because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You will see greater things than that.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_51"><sup>51</sup>He then added, <font color="red">“Very truly I tell you,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek is plural.">⚓</a><font color="red">you</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek is plural.">⚓</a><font color="red">will see ‘heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:12">⚓</a><font color="red">the Son of Man.”</font><br/></span>
