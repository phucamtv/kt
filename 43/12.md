<div class="title"><h1>12</h1><h3>Jesus Anointed at Bethany </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_12_1"> <sup>1</sup>Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_2"><sup>2</sup>Here a dinner was given in Jesus’ honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_3"><sup>3</sup>Then Mary took about a pint<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or about 0.5 liter">⚓</a> of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus’ feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_4"> <sup>4</sup>But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected, </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_5"><sup>5</sup>“Why wasn’t this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year’s wages.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Greek three hundred denarii">⚓</a> ” </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_6"><sup>6</sup>He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_7"> <sup>7</sup><font color="red">“Leave her alone,”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="red">“It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">You will always have the poor among you,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="See Deut. 15:11.">⚓</a><font color="red">but you will not always have me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_9"> <sup>9</sup>Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_10"><sup>10</sup>So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_11"><sup>11</sup>for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and believing in him. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Comes to Jerusalem as King </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_12_12"> <sup>12</sup>The next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_13"><sup>13</sup>They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, <br/>  “Hosanna!<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="A Hebrew expression meaning “Save!” which became an exclamation of praise">⚓</a> ” <br/><br/>  “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 118:25,26">⚓</a><br/><br/>  “Blessed is the king of Israel!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_14"><sup>14</sup>Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, as it is written: <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_15">  <sup>15</sup>“Do not be afraid, Daughter Zion; <br/>   see, your king is coming, <br/>   seated on a donkey’s colt.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 9:9">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_16"> <sup>16</sup>At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that these things had been done to him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_17"> <sup>17</sup>Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word. </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_18"><sup>18</sup>Many people, because they had heard that he had performed this sign, went out to meet him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_19"><sup>19</sup>So the Pharisees said to one another, “See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!” <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Predicts His Death </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_12_20"> <sup>20</sup>Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the festival. </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_21"><sup>21</sup>They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. “Sir,” they said, “we would like to see Jesus.” </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_22"><sup>22</sup>Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_23"> <sup>23</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_27"> <sup>27</sup><font color="red">“Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this hour’? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_28"><sup>28</sup><font color="red">Father, glorify your name!”</font><br/> Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.” </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_29"><sup>29</sup>The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_30"> <sup>30</sup>Jesus said, <font color="red">“This voice was for your benefit, not mine.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">And I, when I am lifted up</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek for lifted up also means exalted .">⚓</a><font color="red">from the earth, will draw all people to myself.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_33"><sup>33</sup>He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_34"> <sup>34</sup>The crowd spoke up, “We have heard from the Law that the Messiah will remain forever, so how can you say, <font color="red">‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’</font>? Who is this ‘Son of Man’?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_35"> <sup>35</sup>Then Jesus told them, <font color="red">“You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. Whoever walks in the dark does not know where they are going.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_36"><sup>36</sup><font color="red">Believe in the light while you have the light, so that you may become children of light.”</font> When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Belief and Unbelief Among the Jews </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_12_37"> <sup>37</sup>Even after Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_38"><sup>38</sup>This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: <br/>  “Lord, who has believed our message <br/>   and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 53:1">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_39"> <sup>39</sup>For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere: <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_40">  <sup>40</sup>“He has blinded their eyes <br/>   and hardened their hearts, <br/>  so they can neither see with their eyes, <br/>   nor understand with their hearts, <br/>   nor turn—and I would heal them.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 6:10">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_41"><sup>41</sup>Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_42"> <sup>42</sup>Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_43"><sup>43</sup>for they loved human praise more than praise from God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_44"> <sup>44</sup>Then Jesus cried out, <font color="red">“Whoever believes in me does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_45"><sup>45</sup><font color="red">The one who looks at me is seeing the one who sent me.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_46"><sup>46</sup><font color="red">I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_47"> <sup>47</sup><font color="red">“If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge that person. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_48"><sup>48</sup><font color="red">There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; the very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_49"><sup>49</sup><font color="red">For I did not speak on my own, but the Father who sent me commanded me to say all that I have spoken.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_50"><sup>50</sup><font color="red">I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say.”</font><br/></span>
