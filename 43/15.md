<div class="title"><h1>15</h1><h3>The Vine and the Branches </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_15_1"> <sup>1</sup><font color="red">“I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_2"><sup>2</sup><font color="red">He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek for he prunes also means he cleans .">⚓</a><font color="red">so that it will be even more fruitful.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_5"> <sup>5</sup><font color="red">“I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_9"> <sup>9</sup><font color="red">“As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commands and remain in his love.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">You are my friends if you do what I command.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master’s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last—and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">This is my command: Love each other.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The World Hates the Disciples </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_15_18"> <sup>18</sup><font color="red">“If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">Remember what I told you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 13:16">⚓</a><font color="red">If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the one who sent me.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">Whoever hates me hates my Father as well.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">If I had not done among them the works no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. As it is, they have seen, and yet they have hated both me and my Father.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: ‘They hated me without reason.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalms 35:19; 69:4">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_26"> <sup>26</sup><font color="red">“When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father—he will testify about me.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_15_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">And you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning.</font><br/></span>
