<div class="title"><h1>10</h1><h3>The Good Shepherd and His Sheep </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_10_1"> <sup>1</sup><font color="red">“Very truly I tell you Pharisees, anyone who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_2"><sup>2</sup><font color="red">The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger’s voice.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_6"><sup>6</sup>Jesus used this figure of speech, but the Pharisees did not understand what he was telling them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_7"> <sup>7</sup>Therefore Jesus said again, <font color="red">“Very truly I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">All who have come before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep have not listened to them.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or kept safe">⚓</a><font color="red">They will come in and go out, and find pasture.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_11"> <sup>11</sup><font color="red">“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_14"> <sup>14</sup><font color="red">“I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me—</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life—only to take it up again.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_19"> <sup>19</sup>The Jews who heard these words were again divided. </span>
<span class="verse gi_10_20"><sup>20</sup>Many of them said, “He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_21"> <sup>21</sup>But others said, “These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?” <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Further Conflict Over Jesus’ Claims </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_10_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then came the Festival of Dedication<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, Hanukkah">⚓</a> at Jerusalem. It was winter, </span>
<span class="verse gi_10_23"><sup>23</sup>and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon’s Colonnade. </span>
<span class="verse gi_10_24"><sup>24</sup>The Jews who were there gathered around him, saying, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_25"> <sup>25</sup>Jesus answered, <font color="red">“I did tell you, but you do not believe. The works I do in my Father’s name testify about me,</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">but you do not believe because you are not my sheep.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_28"><sup>28</sup><font color="red">I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Many early manuscripts What my Father has given me is greater than all">⚓</a><font color="red">; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">I and the Father are one.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_31"> <sup>31</sup>Again his Jewish opponents picked up stones to stone him, </span>
<span class="verse gi_10_32"><sup>32</sup>but Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_33"> <sup>33</sup>“We are not stoning you for any good work,” they replied, “but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_34"> <sup>34</sup>Jesus answered them, <font color="red">“Is it not written in your Law, ‘I have said you are “gods” ’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 82:6">⚓</a><font color="red">?</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be set aside—</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_36"><sup>36</sup><font color="red">what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, ‘I am God’s Son’?</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_37"><sup>37</sup><font color="red">Do not believe me unless I do the works of my Father.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_38"><sup>38</sup><font color="red">But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_39"><sup>39</sup>Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_10_40"> <sup>40</sup>Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days. There he stayed, </span>
<span class="verse gi_10_41"><sup>41</sup>and many people came to him. They said, “Though John never performed a sign, all that John said about this man was true.” </span>
<span class="verse gi_10_42"><sup>42</sup>And in that place many believed in Jesus. <br/></span>
