<div class="title"><h1>13</h1><h3>Jesus Washes His Disciples’ Feet </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_13_1"> <sup>1</sup>It was just before the Passover Festival. Jesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_2"> <sup>2</sup>The evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already prompted Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse gi_13_3"><sup>3</sup>Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God; </span>
<span class="verse gi_13_4"><sup>4</sup>so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. </span>
<span class="verse gi_13_5"><sup>5</sup>After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples’ feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_6"> <sup>6</sup>He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_7"> <sup>7</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_8"> <sup>8</sup>“No,” said Peter, “you shall never wash my feet.” <br/> Jesus answered, <font color="red">“Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_9"> <sup>9</sup>“Then, Lord,” Simon Peter replied, “not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_10"> <sup>10</sup>Jesus answered, <font color="red">“Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_11"><sup>11</sup>For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_12"> <sup>12</sup>When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. <font color="red">“Do you understand what I have done for you?”</font> he asked them. </span>
<span class="verse gi_13_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">“You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and rightly so, for that is what I am.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Predicts His Betrayal </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_13_18"> <sup>18</sup><font color="red">“I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill this passage of Scripture: ‘He who shared my bread has turned</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 13:18 Greek  has lifted up his heel ">⚓</a><font color="red">against me.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 41:9">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_19"> <sup>19</sup><font color="red">“I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe that I am who I am.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">Very truly I tell you, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_21"> <sup>21</sup>After he had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, <font color="red">“Very truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_22"> <sup>22</sup>His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant. </span>
<span class="verse gi_13_23"><sup>23</sup>One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_13_24"><sup>24</sup>Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, “Ask him which one he means.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_25"> <sup>25</sup>Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, “Lord, who is it?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_26"> <sup>26</sup>Jesus answered, <font color="red">“It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.”</font> Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. </span>
<span class="verse gi_13_27"><sup>27</sup>As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. <br/> So Jesus told him, <font color="red">“What you are about to do, do quickly.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_28"><sup>28</sup>But no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_13_29"><sup>29</sup>Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the festival, or to give something to the poor. </span>
<span class="verse gi_13_30"><sup>30</sup>As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_13_31"> <sup>31</sup>When he was gone, Jesus said, <font color="red">“Now the Son of Man is glorified and God is glorified in him.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">If God is glorified in him,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Many early manuscripts do not have If God is glorified in him.">⚓</a><font color="red">God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_33"> <sup>33</sup><font color="red">“My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_34"> <sup>34</sup><font color="red">“A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_36"> <sup>36</sup>Simon Peter asked him, “Lord, where are you going?” <br/> Jesus replied, <font color="red">“Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_37"> <sup>37</sup>Peter asked, “Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_38"> <sup>38</sup>Then Jesus answered, <font color="red">“Will you really lay down your life for me? Very truly I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times!</font><br/></span>
