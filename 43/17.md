<span class="verse gi_17_6"> <sup>6</sup><font color="red">“I have revealed you</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 17:6 Greek  your name ">⚓</a><font color="red">to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_17_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_17_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_17_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours.</font></span>

<span class="verse gi_17_13"> <sup>13</sup><font color="red">“I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_17_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_17_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_17_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">They are not of the world, even as I am not of it.</font></span>
