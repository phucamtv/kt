<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Jesus Changes Water Into Wine </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there, </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_2"><sup>2</sup>and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_3"><sup>3</sup>When the wine was gone, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no more wine.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_4"> <sup>4</sup><font color="red">“Woman,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 2:4 The Greek for  Woman does not denote any disrespect. ">⚓</a><font color="red">why do you involve me?”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="red">“My hour has not yet come.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_5"> <sup>5</sup>His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_6"> <sup>6</sup>Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or from about 75 to about 115 liters">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_7"> <sup>7</sup>Jesus said to the servants, <font color="red">“Fill the jars with water”</font>; so they filled them to the brim. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then he told them, <font color="red">“Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.”</font><br/> They did so, </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_9"><sup>9</sup>and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_10"><sup>10</sup>and said, “Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_11"> <sup>11</sup>What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs through which he revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_12"> <sup>12</sup>After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Clears the Temple Courts </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_2_13"> <sup>13</sup>When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_14"><sup>14</sup>In the temple courts he found people selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money. </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_15"><sup>15</sup>So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_16"><sup>16</sup>To those who sold doves he said, <font color="red">“Get these out of here! Stop turning my Father’s house into a market!”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_17"><sup>17</sup>His disciples remembered that it is written: “Zeal for your house will consume me.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 69:9">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_18"> <sup>18</sup>The Jews then responded to him, “What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_19"> <sup>19</sup>Jesus answered them, <font color="red">“Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_20"> <sup>20</sup>They replied, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?” </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_21"><sup>21</sup>But the temple he had spoken of was his body. </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_22"><sup>22</sup>After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_23"> <sup>23</sup>Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or in him">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_24"><sup>24</sup>But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people. </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_25"><sup>25</sup>He did not need any testimony about mankind, for he knew what was in each person. <br/></span>
