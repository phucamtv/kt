<div class="title"><h1>14</h1><h3>Jesus Comforts His Disciples </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_14_1"> <sup>1</sup><font color="red">“Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 14:1 Or  Believe in God ">⚓</a><font color="red">; believe also in me.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_2"><sup>2</sup><font color="red">My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">You know the way to the place where I am going.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus the Way to the Father </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_14_5"> <sup>5</sup>Thomas said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_6"> <sup>6</sup>Jesus answered, <font color="red">“I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">If you really know me, you will know</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts If you really knew me, you would know">⚓</a><font color="red">my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_8"> <sup>8</sup>Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_9"> <sup>9</sup>Jesus answered: <font color="red">“Don’t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Promises the Holy Spirit </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_14_15"> <sup>15</sup><font color="red">“If you love me, keep my commands.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever—</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some early manuscripts and is">⚓</a><font color="red">in you.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, “But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_23"> <sup>23</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_25"> <sup>25</sup><font color="red">“All this I have spoken while still with you.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_28"> <sup>28</sup><font color="red">“You heard me say, ‘I am going away and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">I will not say much more to you, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold over me,</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_14_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">but he comes so that the world may learn that I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me.</font><br/> <font color="red">“Come now; let us leave.</font><br/></span>
