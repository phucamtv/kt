<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>The Healing at the Pool </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals. </span>
<span class="verse gi_5_2"><sup>2</sup>Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts Bethzatha ; other manuscripts Bethsaida">⚓</a> and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades. </span>
<span class="verse gi_5_3"><sup>3</sup>Here a great number of disabled people used to lie—the blind, the lame, the paralyzed. </span>
<span class="verse gi_5_4"><sup>[4]</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts include here, wholly or in part, paralyzed—and they waited for the moving of the waters. 4From time to time an angel of the Lord would come down and stir up the waters. The first one into the pool after each such disturbance would be cured of whatever disease they had.">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_5"><sup>5</sup>One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. </span>
<span class="verse gi_5_6"><sup>6</sup>When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, <font color="red">“Do you want to get well?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_7"> <sup>7</sup>“Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_9"><sup>9</sup>At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. <br/> The day on which this took place was a Sabbath, </span>
<span class="verse gi_5_10"><sup>10</sup>and so the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_11"> <sup>11</sup>But he replied, “The man who made me well said to me, <font color="red">‘Pick up your mat and walk.’</font> ” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_12"> <sup>12</sup>So they asked him, “Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_13"> <sup>13</sup>The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_14"> <sup>14</sup>Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, <font color="red">“See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_15"><sup>15</sup>The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Authority of the Son </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_5_16"> <sup>16</sup>So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began to persecute him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_5_17"><sup>17</sup>In his defense Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_18"><sup>18</sup>For this reason they tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_19"> <sup>19</sup>Jesus gave them this answer: <font color="red">“Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_24"> <sup>24</sup><font color="red">“Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">Very truly I tell you, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_28"> <sup>28</sup><font color="red">“Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">and come out—those who have done what is good will rise to live, and those who have done what is evil will rise to be condemned.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Testimonies About Jesus </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_5_31"> <sup>31</sup><font color="red">“If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is true.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_33"> <sup>33</sup><font color="red">“You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_34"><sup>34</sup><font color="red">Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_36"> <sup>36</sup><font color="red">“I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to finish—the very works that I am doing—testify that the Father has sent me.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_37"><sup>37</sup><font color="red">And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form,</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_38"><sup>38</sup><font color="red">nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_39"><sup>39</sup><font color="red">You study</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or 39Study">⚓</a><font color="red">the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me,</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_40"><sup>40</sup><font color="red">yet you refuse to come to me to have life.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_41"> <sup>41</sup><font color="red">“I do not accept glory from human beings,</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_42"><sup>42</sup><font color="red">but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_43"><sup>43</sup><font color="red">I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_44"><sup>44</sup><font color="red">How can you believe since you accept glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some early manuscripts the Only One">⚓</a><font color="red">?</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_45"> <sup>45</sup><font color="red">“But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_46"><sup>46</sup><font color="red">If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_47"><sup>47</sup><font color="red">But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?”</font><br/></span>
