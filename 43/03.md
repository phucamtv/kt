<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>Jesus Teaches Nicodemus </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council. </span>
<span class="verse gi_3_2"><sup>2</sup>He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_3_3"> <sup>3</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek for again also means from above ; also in verse 7.">⚓</a><font color="red">”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_3_4"> <sup>4</sup>“How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_3_5"> <sup>5</sup>Jesus answered, <font color="red">“Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_3_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or but spirit">⚓</a><font color="red">gives birth to spirit.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_3_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">You should not be surprised at my saying, ‘You</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek is plural.">⚓</a><font color="red">must be born again.’</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_3_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek for Spirit is the same as that for wind .">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_3_9"> <sup>9</sup>“How can this be?” Nicodemus asked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_3_10"> <sup>10</sup><font color="red">“You are Israel’s teacher,”</font> said Jesus, <font color="red">“and do you not understand these things?</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_3_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_3_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_3_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son of Man.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts Man, who is in heaven">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse gi_3_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek for lifted up also means exalted .">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse gi_3_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him.”</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some interpreters end the quotation with verse 21.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_3_16"> <sup>16</sup>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. </span>
<span class="verse gi_3_17"><sup>17</sup>For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_3_18"><sup>18</sup>Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. </span>
<span class="verse gi_3_19"><sup>19</sup>This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. </span>
<span class="verse gi_3_20"><sup>20</sup>Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. </span>
<span class="verse gi_3_21"><sup>21</sup>But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>John Testifies Again About Jesus </h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_3_22"> <sup>22</sup>After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. </span>
<span class="verse gi_3_23"><sup>23</sup>Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were coming and being baptized. </span>
<span class="verse gi_3_24"><sup>24</sup>(This was before John was put in prison.) </span>
<span class="verse gi_3_25"><sup>25</sup>An argument developed between some of John’s disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. </span>
<span class="verse gi_3_26"><sup>26</sup>They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan—the one you testified about—look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_3_27"> <sup>27</sup>To this John replied, “A person can receive only what is given them from heaven. </span>
<span class="verse gi_3_28"><sup>28</sup>You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him.’ </span>
<span class="verse gi_3_29"><sup>29</sup>The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. </span>
<span class="verse gi_3_30"><sup>30</sup>He must become greater; I must become less.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some interpreters end the quotation with verse 36.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_3_31"> <sup>31</sup>The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. </span>
<span class="verse gi_3_32"><sup>32</sup>He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. </span>
<span class="verse gi_3_33"><sup>33</sup>Whoever has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. </span>
<span class="verse gi_3_34"><sup>34</sup>For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Greek he">⚓</a> gives the Spirit without limit. </span>
<span class="verse gi_3_35"><sup>35</sup>The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. </span>
<span class="verse gi_3_36"><sup>36</sup>Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them. <br/></span>
