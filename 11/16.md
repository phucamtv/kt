<div class="title"><h1>16</h1><h3>Baasha King of Israel </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then the word of the Lord came to Jehu son of Hanani concerning Baasha: </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_2"><sup>2</sup>“I lifted you up from the dust and appointed you ruler over my people Israel, but you followed the ways of Jeroboam and caused my people Israel to sin and to arouse my anger by their sins. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_3"><sup>3</sup>So I am about to wipe out Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_4"><sup>4</sup>Dogs will eat those belonging to Baasha who die in the city, and birds will feed on those who die in the country.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_5"> <sup>5</sup>As for the other events of Baasha’s reign, what he did and his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_6"><sup>6</sup>Baasha rested with his ancestors and was buried in Tirzah. And Elah his son succeeded him as king. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_7"> <sup>7</sup>Moreover, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani to Baasha and his house, because of all the evil he had done in the eyes of the Lord, arousing his anger by the things he did, becoming like the house of Jeroboam—and also because he destroyed it. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Elah King of Israel </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_8"> <sup>8</sup>In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel, and he reigned in Tirzah two years. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_9"> <sup>9</sup>Zimri, one of his officials, who had command of half his chariots, plotted against him. Elah was in Tirzah at the time, getting drunk in the home of Arza, the palace administrator at Tirzah. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_10"><sup>10</sup>Zimri came in, struck him down and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah. Then he succeeded him as king. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_11"> <sup>11</sup>As soon as he began to reign and was seated on the throne, he killed off Baasha’s whole family. He did not spare a single male, whether relative or friend. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_12"><sup>12</sup>So Zimri destroyed the whole family of Baasha, in accordance with the word of the Lord spoken against Baasha through the prophet Jehu— </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_13"><sup>13</sup>because of all the sins Baasha and his son Elah had committed and had caused Israel to commit, so that they aroused the anger of the Lord, the God of Israel, by their worthless idols. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_14"> <sup>14</sup>As for the other events of Elah’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Zimri King of Israel </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_15"> <sup>15</sup>In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned in Tirzah seven days. The army was encamped near Gibbethon, a Philistine town. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_16"><sup>16</sup>When the Israelites in the camp heard that Zimri had plotted against the king and murdered him, they proclaimed Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that very day there in the camp. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_17"><sup>17</sup>Then Omri and all the Israelites with him withdrew from Gibbethon and laid siege to Tirzah. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_18"><sup>18</sup>When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the royal palace and set the palace on fire around him. So he died, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_19"><sup>19</sup>because of the sins he had committed, doing evil in the eyes of the Lord and following the ways of Jeroboam and committing the same sin Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_20"> <sup>20</sup>As for the other events of Zimri’s reign, and the rebellion he carried out, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Omri King of Israel </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then the people of Israel were split into two factions; half supported Tibni son of Ginath for king, and the other half supported Omri. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_22"><sup>22</sup>But Omri’s followers proved stronger than those of Tibni son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri became king. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_23"> <sup>23</sup>In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned twelve years, six of them in Tirzah. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_24"><sup>24</sup>He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 150 pounds or about 68 kilograms">⚓</a> of silver and built a city on the hill, calling it Samaria, after Shemer, the name of the former owner of the hill. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_25"> <sup>25</sup>But Omri did evil in the eyes of the Lord and sinned more than all those before him. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_26"><sup>26</sup>He followed completely the ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat, committing the same sin Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit, so that they aroused the anger of the Lord, the God of Israel, by their worthless idols. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_27"> <sup>27</sup>As for the other events of Omri’s reign, what he did and the things he achieved, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_28"><sup>28</sup>Omri rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria. And Ahab his son succeeded him as king. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Ahab Becomes King of Israel </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_29"> <sup>29</sup>In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab son of Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria over Israel twenty-two years. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_30"><sup>30</sup>Ahab son of Omri did more evil in the eyes of the Lord than any of those before him. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_31"><sup>31</sup>He not only considered it trivial to commit the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, but he also married Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and began to serve Baal and worship him. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_32"><sup>32</sup>He set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal that he built in Samaria. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_33"><sup>33</sup>Ahab also made an Asherah pole and did more to arouse the anger of the Lord, the God of Israel, than did all the kings of Israel before him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_34"> <sup>34</sup>In Ahab’s time, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundations at the cost of his firstborn son Abiram, and he set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, in accordance with the word of the Lord spoken by Joshua son of Nun. <br/></span>
