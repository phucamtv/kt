<div class="title"><h1>7</h1><h3>Solomon Builds His Palace </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_1"> <sup>1</sup>It took Solomon thirteen years, however, to complete the construction of his palace. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_2"><sup>2</sup>He built the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon a hundred cubits long, fifty wide and thirty high,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 150 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high or about 45 meters long, 23 meters wide and 14 meters high">⚓</a> with four rows of cedar columns supporting trimmed cedar beams. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_3"><sup>3</sup>It was roofed with cedar above the beams that rested on the columns—forty-five beams, fifteen to a row. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_4"><sup>4</sup>Its windows were placed high in sets of three, facing each other. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_5"><sup>5</sup>All the doorways had rectangular frames; they were in the front part in sets of three, facing each other.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this verse is uncertain.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_6"> <sup>6</sup>He made a colonnade fifty cubits long and thirty wide.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 75 feet long and 45 feet wide or about 23 meters long and 14 meters wide">⚓</a> In front of it was a portico, and in front of that were pillars and an overhanging roof. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_7"> <sup>7</sup>He built the throne hall, the Hall of Justice, where he was to judge, and he covered it with cedar from floor to ceiling.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Vulgate and Syriac; Hebrew floor">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_8"><sup>8</sup>And the palace in which he was to live, set farther back, was similar in design. Solomon also made a palace like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had married. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_9"> <sup>9</sup>All these structures, from the outside to the great courtyard and from foundation to eaves, were made of blocks of high-grade stone cut to size and smoothed on their inner and outer faces. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_10"><sup>10</sup>The foundations were laid with large stones of good quality, some measuring ten cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 15 feet or about 4.5 meters; also in verse 23">⚓</a> and some eight.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 12 feet or about 3.6 meters">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_11"><sup>11</sup>Above were high-grade stones, cut to size, and cedar beams. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_12"><sup>12</sup>The great courtyard was surrounded by a wall of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams, as was the inner courtyard of the temple of the Lord with its portico. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Temple’s Furnishings </h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_13"> <sup>13</sup>King Solomon sent to Tyre and brought Huram,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew Hiram, a variant of Huram ; also in verses 40 and 45">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_14"><sup>14</sup>whose mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali and whose father was from Tyre and a skilled craftsman in bronze. Huram was filled with wisdom, with understanding and with knowledge to do all kinds of bronze work. He came to King Solomon and did all the work assigned to him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_15"> <sup>15</sup>He cast two bronze pillars, each eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 27 feet high and 18 feet in circumference or about 8.1 meters high and 5.4 meters in circumference">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_16"><sup>16</sup>He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; each capital was five cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 7 1/2 feet or about 2.3 meters; also in verse 23">⚓</a> high. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_17"><sup>17</sup>A network of interwoven chains adorned the capitals on top of the pillars, seven for each capital. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_18"><sup>18</sup>He made pomegranates in two rows<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Two Hebrew manuscripts and Septuagint; most Hebrew manuscripts made the pillars, and there were two rows">⚓</a> encircling each network to decorate the capitals on top of the pillars.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Many Hebrew manuscripts and Syriac; most Hebrew manuscripts pomegranates">⚓</a> He did the same for each capital. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_19"><sup>19</sup>The capitals on top of the pillars in the portico were in the shape of lilies, four cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 6 feet or about 1.8 meters; also in verse 38">⚓</a> high. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_20"><sup>20</sup>On the capitals of both pillars, above the bowl-shaped part next to the network, were the two hundred pomegranates in rows all around. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_21"><sup>21</sup>He erected the pillars at the portico of the temple. The pillar to the south he named Jakin<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="probably means he establishes.">⚓</a> and the one to the north Boaz.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="probably means in him is strength.">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_22"><sup>22</sup>The capitals on top were in the shape of lilies. And so the work on the pillars was completed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_23"> <sup>23</sup>He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 45 feet or about 14 meters">⚓</a> to measure around it. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_24"><sup>24</sup>Below the rim, gourds encircled it—ten to a cubit. The gourds were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_25"> <sup>25</sup>The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_26"><sup>26</sup>It was a handbreadth<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 3 inches or about 7.5 centimeters">⚓</a> in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held two thousand baths.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 12,000 gallons or about 44,000 liters; the Septuagint does not have this sentence.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_27"> <sup>27</sup>He also made ten movable stands of bronze; each was four cubits long, four wide and three high.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 6 feet long and wide and about 4 1/2 feet high or about 1.8 meters long and wide and 1.4 meters high">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_28"><sup>28</sup>This is how the stands were made: They had side panels attached to uprights. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_29"><sup>29</sup>On the panels between the uprights were lions, bulls and cherubim—and on the uprights as well. Above and below the lions and bulls were wreaths of hammered work. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_30"><sup>30</sup>Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and each had a basin resting on four supports, cast with wreaths on each side. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_31"><sup>31</sup>On the inside of the stand there was an opening that had a circular frame one cubit<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 18 inches or about 45 centimeters">⚓</a> deep. This opening was round, and with its basework it measured a cubit and a half.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 2 1/4 feet or about 68 centimeters; also in verse 32">⚓</a> Around its opening there was engraving. The panels of the stands were square, not round. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_32"><sup>32</sup>The four wheels were under the panels, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand. The diameter of each wheel was a cubit and a half. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_33"><sup>33</sup>The wheels were made like chariot wheels; the axles, rims, spokes and hubs were all of cast metal. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_34"> <sup>34</sup>Each stand had four handles, one on each corner, projecting from the stand. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_35"><sup>35</sup>At the top of the stand there was a circular band half a cubit<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 9 inches or about 23 centimeters">⚓</a> deep. The supports and panels were attached to the top of the stand. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_36"><sup>36</sup>He engraved cherubim, lions and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and on the panels, in every available space, with wreaths all around. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_37"><sup>37</sup>This is the way he made the ten stands. They were all cast in the same molds and were identical in size and shape. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_38"> <sup>38</sup>He then made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 240 gallons or about 880 liters">⚓</a> and measuring four cubits across, one basin to go on each of the ten stands. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_39"><sup>39</sup>He placed five of the stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north. He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner of the temple. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_40"><sup>40</sup>He also made the pots<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Many Hebrew manuscripts, Septuagint, Syriac and Vulgate (see also verse 45 and 2 Chron. 4:11); many other Hebrew manuscripts basins">⚓</a> and shovels and sprinkling bowls. <br/> So Huram finished all the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of the Lord: <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_41">  <sup>41</sup>the two pillars; <br/>  the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; <br/>  the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_42">  <sup>42</sup>the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars); <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_43">  <sup>43</sup>the ten stands with their ten basins; <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_44">  <sup>44</sup>the Sea and the twelve bulls under it; <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_45">  <sup>45</sup>the pots, shovels and sprinkling bowls. <br/> All these objects that Huram made for King Solomon for the temple of the Lord were of burnished bronze. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_46"><sup>46</sup>The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Sukkoth and Zarethan. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_47"><sup>47</sup>Solomon left all these things unweighed, because there were so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_48"> <sup>48</sup>Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in the Lord’s temple: <br/>  the golden altar; <br/>  the golden table on which was the bread of the Presence; <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_49">  <sup>49</sup>the lampstands of pure gold (five on the right and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary); <br/>  the gold floral work and lamps and tongs; <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_50">  <sup>50</sup>the pure gold basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers; <br/>  and the gold sockets for the doors of the innermost room, the Most Holy Place, and also for the doors of the main hall of the temple. <br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_51"> <sup>51</sup>When all the work King Solomon had done for the temple of the Lord was finished, he brought in the things his father David had dedicated—the silver and gold and the furnishings—and he placed them in the treasuries of the Lord’s temple. <br/></span>
