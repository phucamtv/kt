<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>Submit Yourselves to God </h3></div>
<span class="verse gia_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don’t they come from your desires that battle within you? </span>
<span class="verse gia_4_2"><sup>2</sup>You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God. </span>
<span class="verse gia_4_3"><sup>3</sup>When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gia_4_4"> <sup>4</sup>You adulterous people,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="An allusion to covenant unfaithfulness; see Hosea 3:1.">⚓</a> don’t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God. </span>
<span class="verse gia_4_5"><sup>5</sup>Or do you think Scripture says without reason that he jealously longs for the spirit he has caused to dwell in us<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or that the spirit he caused to dwell in us envies intensely; or that the Spirit he caused to dwell in us longs jealously">⚓</a> ? </span>
<span class="verse gia_4_6"><sup>6</sup>But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says: <br/>  “God opposes the proud <br/>   but shows favor to the humble.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 3:34">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse gia_4_7"> <sup>7</sup>Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. </span>
<span class="verse gia_4_8"><sup>8</sup>Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. </span>
<span class="verse gia_4_9"><sup>9</sup>Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom. </span>
<span class="verse gia_4_10"><sup>10</sup>Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gia_4_11"> <sup>11</sup>Brothers and sisters, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against a brother or sister<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek word for brother or sister (adelphos ) refers here to a believer, whether man or woman, as part of God’s family.">⚓</a> or judges them speaks against the law and judges it. When you judge the law, you are not keeping it, but sitting in judgment on it. </span>
<span class="verse gia_4_12"><sup>12</sup>There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and destroy. But you—who are you to judge your neighbor? <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Boasting About Tomorrow </h3></div>
<span class="verse gia_4_13"> <sup>13</sup>Now listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.” </span>
<span class="verse gia_4_14"><sup>14</sup>Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. </span>
<span class="verse gia_4_15"><sup>15</sup>Instead, you ought to say, “If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that.” </span>
<span class="verse gia_4_16"><sup>16</sup>As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil. </span>
<span class="verse gia_4_17"><sup>17</sup>If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it is sin for them. <br/></span>
