<div class="title"><h1>15</h1><h3>Allotment for Judah </h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_15_1"> <sup>1</sup>The allotment for the tribe of Judah, according to its clans, extended down to the territory of Edom, to the Desert of Zin in the extreme south. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_15_2"> <sup>2</sup>Their southern boundary started from the bay at the southern end of the Dead Sea, </span>
<span class="verse gios_15_3"><sup>3</sup>crossed south of Scorpion Pass, continued on to Zin and went over to the south of Kadesh Barnea. Then it ran past Hezron up to Addar and curved around to Karka. </span>
<span class="verse gios_15_4"><sup>4</sup>It then passed along to Azmon and joined the Wadi of Egypt, ending at the Mediterranean Sea. This is their<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint; Hebrew your">⚓</a> southern boundary. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_15_5"> <sup>5</sup>The eastern boundary is the Dead Sea as far as the mouth of the Jordan. <br/> The northern boundary started from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan, </span>
<span class="verse gios_15_6"><sup>6</sup>went up to Beth Hoglah and continued north of Beth Arabah to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben. </span>
<span class="verse gios_15_7"><sup>7</sup>The boundary then went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor and turned north to Gilgal, which faces the Pass of Adummim south of the gorge. It continued along to the waters of En Shemesh and came out at En Rogel. </span>
<span class="verse gios_15_8"><sup>8</sup>Then it ran up the Valley of Ben Hinnom along the southern slope of the Jebusite city (that is, Jerusalem). From there it climbed to the top of the hill west of the Hinnom Valley at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim. </span>
<span class="verse gios_15_9"><sup>9</sup>From the hilltop the boundary headed toward the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, came out at the towns of Mount Ephron and went down toward Baalah (that is, Kiriath Jearim). </span>
<span class="verse gios_15_10"><sup>10</sup>Then it curved westward from Baalah to Mount Seir, ran along the northern slope of Mount Jearim (that is, Kesalon), continued down to Beth Shemesh and crossed to Timnah. </span>
<span class="verse gios_15_11"><sup>11</sup>It went to the northern slope of Ekron, turned toward Shikkeron, passed along to Mount Baalah and reached Jabneel. The boundary ended at the sea. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_15_12"> <sup>12</sup>The western boundary is the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea. <br/> These are the boundaries around the people of Judah by their clans. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_15_13"> <sup>13</sup>In accordance with the Lord’s command to him, Joshua gave to Caleb son of Jephunneh a portion in Judah—Kiriath Arba, that is, Hebron. (Arba was the forefather of Anak.) </span>
<span class="verse gios_15_14"><sup>14</sup>From Hebron Caleb drove out the three Anakites—Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai, the sons of Anak. </span>
<span class="verse gios_15_15"><sup>15</sup>From there he marched against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher). </span>
<span class="verse gios_15_16"><sup>16</sup>And Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Aksah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher.” </span>
<span class="verse gios_15_17"><sup>17</sup>Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s brother, took it; so Caleb gave his daughter Aksah to him in marriage. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_15_18"> <sup>18</sup>One day when she came to Othniel, she urged him<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew and some Septuagint manuscripts; other Septuagint manuscripts (see also note at Judges 1:14) Othniel, he urged her">⚓</a> to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What can I do for you?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_15_19"> <sup>19</sup>She replied, “Do me a special favor. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs. <br/></span>
