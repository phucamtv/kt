<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>Jesus and John the Baptist </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>After Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Greek in their towns">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_2"> <sup>2</sup>When John, who was in prison, heard about the deeds of the Messiah, he sent his disciples </span>
<span class="verse mat_11_3"><sup>3</sup>to ask him, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_4"> <sup>4</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“Go back and report to John what you hear and see:</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek word traditionally translated leprosy was used for various diseases affecting the skin.">⚓</a><font color="red">are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_7"> <sup>7</sup>As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: <font color="red">“What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings’ palaces.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">This is the one about whom it is written: </font><br/>  <font color="red">“ ‘I will send my messenger ahead of you, </font><br/>   <font color="red">who will prepare your way before you.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 11:10 Mal. 3:1 ">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or been forcefully advancing">⚓</a><font color="red">and violent people have been raiding it.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">Whoever has ears, let them hear.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_16"> <sup>16</sup><font color="red">“To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others:</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_17">  <sup>17</sup><font color="red">“ ‘We played the pipe for you, </font><br/>   <font color="red">and you did not dance; </font><br/>  <font color="red">we sang a dirge, </font><br/>   <font color="red">and you did not mourn.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’ But wisdom is proved right by her deeds.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Woe on Unrepentant Towns </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_11_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then Jesus began to denounce the towns in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent. </span>
<span class="verse mat_11_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, the realm of the dead">⚓</a><font color="red">For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Father Revealed in the Son </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_11_25"> <sup>25</sup>At that time Jesus said, <font color="red">“I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_27"> <sup>27</sup><font color="red">“All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_28"> <sup>28</sup><font color="red">“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_11_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”</font><br/></span>
