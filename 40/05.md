<span class="verse mat_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, </span>
<span class="verse mat_5_2"><sup>2</sup>and he began to teach them. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Beatitudes </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_5_2"> He said: <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_3">  <sup>3</sup><font color="red">“Blessed are the poor in spirit, </font><br/>   <font color="red">for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_4">  <sup>4</sup><font color="red">Blessed are those who mourn, </font><br/>   <font color="red">for they will be comforted.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_5">  <sup>5</sup><font color="red">Blessed are the meek, </font><br/>   <font color="red">for they will inherit the earth.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_6">  <sup>6</sup><font color="red">Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, </font><br/>   <font color="red">for they will be filled.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_7">  <sup>7</sup><font color="red">Blessed are the merciful, </font><br/>   <font color="red">for they will be shown mercy.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_8">  <sup>8</sup><font color="red">Blessed are the pure in heart, </font><br/>   <font color="red">for they will see God.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_9">  <sup>9</sup><font color="red">Blessed are the peacemakers, </font><br/>   <font color="red">for they will be called children of God.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_10">  <sup>10</sup><font color="red">Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, </font><br/>   <font color="red">for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_11"> <sup>11</sup><font color="red">“Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Salt and Light </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_5_13"> <sup>13</sup><font color="red">“You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_14"> <sup>14</sup><font color="red">“You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Fulfillment of the Law </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_5_17"> <sup>17</sup><font color="red">“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Murder </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_5_21"> <sup>21</sup><font color="red">“You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘You shall not murder,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 5:21 Exodus 20:13 ">⚓</a><font color="red">and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek word for brother or sister (adelphos ) refers here to a fellow disciple, whether man or woman; also in verse 23.">⚓</a><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts brother or sister without cause">⚓</a><font color="red">will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘</font><em>Raca,’</em><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="An Aramaic term of contempt">⚓</a><font color="red">is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_23"> <sup>23</sup><font color="red">“Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you,</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_25"> <sup>25</sup><font color="red">“Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still together on the way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Adultery </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_5_27"> <sup>27</sup><font color="red">“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 5:27 Exodus 20:14 ">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_28"><sup>28</sup><font color="red">But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Divorce </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_5_31"> <sup>31</sup><font color="red">“It has been said, ‘Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 5:31 Deut. 24:1 ">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Oaths </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_5_33"> <sup>33</sup><font color="red">“Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_34"><sup>34</sup><font color="red">But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God’s throne;</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_36"><sup>36</sup><font color="red">And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_37"><sup>37</sup><font color="red">All you need to say is simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or from evil">⚓</a><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Eye for Eye </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_5_38"> <sup>38</sup><font color="red">“You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 5:38 Exodus 21:24; Lev. 24:20; Deut. 19:21 ">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_39"><sup>39</sup><font color="red">But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_40"><sup>40</sup><font color="red">And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_41"><sup>41</sup><font color="red">If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_42"><sup>42</sup><font color="red">Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Love for Enemies </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_5_43"> <sup>43</sup><font color="red">“You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 5:43 Lev. 19:18 ">⚓</a><font color="red">and hate your enemy.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_44"><sup>44</sup><font color="red">But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_45"><sup>45</sup><font color="red">that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_46"><sup>46</sup><font color="red">If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_47"><sup>47</sup><font color="red">And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_5_48"><sup>48</sup><font color="red">Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</font><br/></span>
