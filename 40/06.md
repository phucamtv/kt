<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>Giving to the Needy </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_6_1"> <sup>1</sup><font color="red">“Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_2"> <sup>2</sup><font color="red">“So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Prayer </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_6_5"> <sup>5</sup><font color="red">“And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_9"> <sup>9</sup><font color="red">“This, then, is how you should pray: </font><br/>  <font color="red">“ ‘Our Father in heaven, </font><br/>  <font color="red">hallowed be your name,</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_10">  <sup>10</sup><font color="red">your kingdom come, </font><br/>  <font color="red">your will be done, </font><br/>   <font color="red">on earth as it is in heaven.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_11">  <sup>11</sup><font color="red">Give us today our daily bread.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_12">  <sup>12</sup><font color="red">And forgive us our debts, </font><br/>   <font color="red">as we also have forgiven our debtors.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_13">  <sup>13</sup><font color="red">And lead us not into temptation,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 6:13 The Greek for  temptation can also mean  testing . ">⚓</a><br/>   <font color="red">but deliver us from the evil one.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 6:13 Or  from evil ; some late manuscripts  one, / for yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.">⚓</a><font color="red">’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Fasting </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_6_16"> <sup>16</sup><font color="red">“When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Treasures in Heaven </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_6_19"> <sup>19</sup><font color="red">“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_22"> <sup>22</sup><font color="red">“The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 6:22 The Greek for  healthy here implies  generous . ">⚓</a><font color="red">your whole body will be full of light.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">But if your eyes are unhealthy,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek for unhealthy here implies stingy .">⚓</a><font color="red">your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_24"> <sup>24</sup><font color="red">“No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Do Not Worry </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_6_25"> <sup>25</sup><font color="red">“Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or single cubit to your height">⚓</a><font color="red">?</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_28"> <sup>28</sup><font color="red">“And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_33"><sup>33</sup><font color="red">But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_6_34"><sup>34</sup><font color="red">Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</font><br/></span>
