<div class="title"><h1>8</h1><h3>Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>When Jesus came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_2"><sup>2</sup>A man with leprosy<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek word traditionally translated leprosy was used for various diseases affecting the skin.">⚓</a> came and knelt before him and said, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_3"> <sup>3</sup>Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. <font color="red">“I am willing,”</font> he said. <font color="red">“Be clean!”</font> Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_4"><sup>4</sup>Then Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Faith of the Centurion </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_8_5"> <sup>5</sup>When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_6"><sup>6</sup>“Lord,” he said, “my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_7"> <sup>7</sup>Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“Shall I come and heal him?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_8"> <sup>8</sup>The centurion replied, “Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_9"><sup>9</sup>For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_10"> <sup>10</sup>When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, <font color="red">“Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then Jesus said to the centurion, <font color="red">“Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would.”</font> And his servant was healed at that moment. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Heals Many </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_8_14"> <sup>14</sup>When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_15"><sup>15</sup>He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_16"> <sup>16</sup>When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_17"><sup>17</sup>This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: <br/>  “He took up our infirmities <br/>   and bore our diseases.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 53:4 (see Septuagint)">⚓</a><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Cost of Following Jesus </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_8_18"> <sup>18</sup>When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_19"><sup>19</sup>Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_20"> <sup>20</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_21"> <sup>21</sup>Another disciple said to him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_22"> <sup>22</sup>But Jesus told him, <font color="red">“Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Calms the Storm </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_8_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_24"><sup>24</sup>Suddenly a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_25"><sup>25</sup>The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Lord, save us! We’re going to drown!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_26"> <sup>26</sup>He replied, <font color="red">“You of little faith, why are you so afraid?”</font> Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_27"> <sup>27</sup>The men were amazed and asked, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!” <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Restores Two Demon-Possessed Men </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_8_28"> <sup>28</sup>When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts Gergesenes ; other manuscripts Gerasenes">⚓</a> two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_29"><sup>29</sup>“What do you want with us, Son of God?” they shouted. “Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_30"> <sup>30</sup>Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_31"><sup>31</sup>The demons begged Jesus, “If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_32"> <sup>32</sup>He said to them, <font color="red">“Go!”</font> So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_33"><sup>33</sup>Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town and reported all this, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_34"><sup>34</sup>Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region. <br/></span>
