<div class="title"><h1>19</h1><h3>Divorce </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_19_1"> <sup>1</sup>When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan. </span>
<span class="verse mat_19_2"><sup>2</sup>Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_3"> <sup>3</sup>Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_4"> <sup>4</sup><font color="red">“Haven’t you read,”</font> he replied, <font color="red">“that at the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 1:27">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:24">⚓</a><font color="red">?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_7"> <sup>7</sup>“Why then,” they asked, “did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_8"> <sup>8</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_10"> <sup>10</sup>The disciples said to him, “If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_11"> <sup>11</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others—and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Little Children and Jesus </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_19_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_14"> <sup>14</sup>Jesus said, <font color="red">“Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_15"><sup>15</sup>When he had placed his hands on them, he went on from there. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Rich and the Kingdom of God </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_19_16"> <sup>16</sup>Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_17"> <sup>17</sup><font color="red">“Why do you ask me about what is good?”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="red">“There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_18"> <sup>18</sup>“Which ones?” he inquired. <br/> Jesus replied, <font color="red">“ ‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony,</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">honor your father and mother,’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Exodus 20:12-16; Deut. 5:16-20">⚓</a><font color="red">and ‘love your neighbor as yourself.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:18">⚓</a><font color="red">”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_20"> <sup>20</sup>“All these I have kept,” the young man said. “What do I still lack?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_21"> <sup>21</sup>Jesus answered, <font color="red">“If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_22"> <sup>22</sup>When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then Jesus said to his disciples, <font color="red">“Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_25"> <sup>25</sup>When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_26"> <sup>26</sup>Jesus looked at them and said, <font color="red">“With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_27"> <sup>27</sup>Peter answered him, “We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_28"> <sup>28</sup>Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts do not have or wife .">⚓</a><font color="red">or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.</font><br/></span>
