<span class="verse mat_10_1"> <sup>1</sup>Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_2"> <sup>2</sup>These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; </span>
<span class="verse mat_10_3"><sup>3</sup>Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; </span>
<span class="verse mat_10_4"><sup>4</sup>Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_5"> <sup>5</sup>These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: <font color="red">“Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">As you go, proclaim this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek word traditionally translated leprosy was used for various diseases affecting the skin.">⚓</a><font color="red">drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_9"> <sup>9</sup><font color="red">“Do not get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts—</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is worth his keep.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">Whatever town or village you enter, search there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">As you enter the home, give it your greeting.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_16"> <sup>16</sup><font color="red">“I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged in the synagogues.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say,</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_21"> <sup>21</sup><font color="red">“Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_24"> <sup>24</sup><font color="red">“The student is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">It is enough for students to be like their teachers, and servants like their masters. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household!</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_26"> <sup>26</sup><font color="red">“So do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_28"><sup>28</sup><font color="red">Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father’s care.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or will ; or knowledge">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_32"> <sup>32</sup><font color="red">“Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_33"><sup>33</sup><font color="red">But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_34"> <sup>34</sup><font color="red">“Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">For I have come to turn </font><br/>  <font color="red">“ ‘a man against his father, </font><br/>   <font color="red">a daughter against her mother, </font><br/>  <font color="red">a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law—</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_36">   <sup>36</sup><font color="red">a man’s enemies will be the members of his own household.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 10:36 Micah 7:6 ">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_37"> <sup>37</sup><font color="red">“Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_38"><sup>38</sup><font color="red">Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_39"><sup>39</sup><font color="red">Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_40"> <sup>40</sup><font color="red">“Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_41"><sup>41</sup><font color="red">Whoever welcomes a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person’s reward.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_10_42"><sup>42</sup><font color="red">And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not lose their reward.”</font><br/></span>
