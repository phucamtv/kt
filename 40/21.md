<div class="title"><h1>21</h1><h3>Jesus Comes to Jerusalem as King </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_21_1"> <sup>1</sup>As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_2"><sup>2</sup>saying to them, <font color="red">“Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_4"> <sup>4</sup>This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet: <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_5">  <sup>5</sup>“Say to Daughter Zion, <br/>   ‘See, your king comes to you, <br/>  gentle and riding on a donkey, <br/>   and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’ ”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 9:9">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_6"> <sup>6</sup>The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them. </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_7"><sup>7</sup>They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them for Jesus to sit on. </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_8"><sup>8</sup>A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_9"><sup>9</sup>The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, <br/>  “Hosanna<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="A Hebrew expression meaning “Save!” which became an exclamation of praise; also in verse 15">⚓</a> to the Son of David!” <br/><br/>  “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 118:25,26">⚓</a><br/><br/>  “Hosanna<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="A Hebrew expression meaning “Save!” which became an exclamation of praise; also in verse 15">⚓</a> in the highest heaven!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_10"> <sup>10</sup>When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, “Who is this?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_11"> <sup>11</sup>The crowds answered, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.” <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus at the Temple </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_21_12"> <sup>12</sup>Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">“It is written,”</font> he said to them, <font color="red">“ ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 56:7">⚓</a><font color="red">but you are making it ‘a den of robbers.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 7:11">⚓</a><font color="red">”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_14"> <sup>14</sup>The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them. </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_15"><sup>15</sup>But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple courts, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they were indignant. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_16"> <sup>16</sup>“Do you hear what these children are saying?” they asked him. <br/> <font color="red">“Yes,”</font> replied Jesus, <font color="red">“have you never read, </font><br/>  <font color="red">“ ‘From the lips of children and infants </font><br/>   <font color="red">you, Lord, have called forth your praise’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 21:16 Psalm 8:2 (see Septuagint) ">⚓</a><font color="red">?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_17"> <sup>17</sup>And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Curses a Fig Tree </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_21_18"> <sup>18</sup>Early in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was hungry. </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_19"><sup>19</sup>Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, <font color="red">“May you never bear fruit again!”</font> Immediately the tree withered. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_20"> <sup>20</sup>When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?” they asked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_21"> <sup>21</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Authority of Jesus Questioned </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_21_23"> <sup>23</sup>Jesus entered the temple courts, and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. “By what authority are you doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave you this authority?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_24"> <sup>24</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">John’s baptism—where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or of human origin?”</font><br/> They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’ </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_26"><sup>26</sup>But if we say, ‘Of human origin’—we are afraid of the people, for they all hold that John was a prophet.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_27"> <sup>27</sup>So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” <br/> Then he said, <font color="red">“Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Two Sons </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_21_28"> <sup>28</sup><font color="red">“What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work today in the vineyard.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_29"> <sup>29</sup><font color="red">“ ‘I will not,’ he answered, but later he changed his mind and went.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_30"> <sup>30</sup><font color="red">“Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I will, sir,’ but he did not go.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_31"> <sup>31</sup><font color="red">“Which of the two did what his father wanted?”</font><br/> “The first,” they answered. <br/> Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Tenants </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_21_33"> <sup>33</sup><font color="red">“Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_34"><sup>34</sup><font color="red">When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_35"> <sup>35</sup><font color="red">“The tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_36"><sup>36</sup><font color="red">Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_37"><sup>37</sup><font color="red">Last of all, he sent his son to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_38"> <sup>38</sup><font color="red">“But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him and take his inheritance.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_39"><sup>39</sup><font color="red">So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_40"> <sup>40</sup><font color="red">“Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_41"> <sup>41</sup>“He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,” they replied, “and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_42"> <sup>42</sup>Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Have you never read in the Scriptures: </font><br/>  <font color="red">“ ‘The stone the builders rejected </font><br/>   <font color="red">has become the cornerstone; </font><br/>  <font color="red">the Lord has done this, </font><br/>   <font color="red">and it is marvelous in our eyes’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 21:42 Psalm 118:22,23 ">⚓</a><font color="red">?</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_43"> <sup>43</sup><font color="red">“Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_44"><sup>44</sup><font color="red">Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.”</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts do not have verse 44.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_45"> <sup>45</sup>When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus’ parables, they knew he was talking about them. </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_46"><sup>46</sup>They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet. <br/></span>
