<div class="title"><h1>22</h1><h3>The Parable of the Wedding Banquet </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_22_1"> <sup>1</sup>Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_2"><sup>2</sup><font color="red">“The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_4"> <sup>4</sup><font color="red">“Then he sent some more servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_5"> <sup>5</sup><font color="red">“But they paid no attention and went off—one to his field, another to his business.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_8"> <sup>8</sup><font color="red">“Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">So go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, the bad as well as the good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_11"> <sup>11</sup><font color="red">“But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">He asked, ‘How did you get in here without wedding clothes, friend?’ The man was speechless.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_13"> <sup>13</sup><font color="red">“Then the king told the attendants, ‘Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_14"> <sup>14</sup><font color="red">“For many are invited, but few are chosen.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Paying the Imperial Tax to Caesar </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_22_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words. </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_16"><sup>16</sup>They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. “Teacher,” they said, “we know that you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren’t swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are. </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_17"><sup>17</sup>Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay the imperial tax<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="A special tax levied on subject peoples, not on Roman citizens">⚓</a> to Caesar or not?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_18"> <sup>18</sup>But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, <font color="red">“You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">Show me the coin used for paying the tax.”</font> They brought him a denarius, </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_20"><sup>20</sup>and he asked them, <font color="red">“Whose image is this? And whose inscription?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_21"> <sup>21</sup>“Caesar’s,” they replied. <br/> Then he said to them, <font color="red">“So give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_22"> <sup>22</sup>When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Marriage at the Resurrection </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_22_23"> <sup>23</sup>That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_24"><sup>24</sup>“Teacher,” they said, “Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for him. </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_25"><sup>25</sup>Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother. </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_26"><sup>26</sup>The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh. </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_27"><sup>27</sup>Finally, the woman died. </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_28"><sup>28</sup>Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_29"> <sup>29</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">But about the resurrection of the dead—have you not read what God said to you,</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Exodus 3:6">⚓</a><font color="red">? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_33"> <sup>33</sup>When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Greatest Commandment </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_22_34"> <sup>34</sup>Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together. </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_35"><sup>35</sup>One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_36"><sup>36</sup>“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_37"> <sup>37</sup>Jesus replied: <font color="red">“ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:5">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_38"><sup>38</sup><font color="red">This is the first and greatest commandment.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_39"><sup>39</sup><font color="red">And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:18">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_40"><sup>40</sup><font color="red">All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Whose Son Is the Messiah? </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_22_41"> <sup>41</sup>While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_42"><sup>42</sup><font color="red">“What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?”</font><br/> “The son of David,” they replied. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_43"> <sup>43</sup>He said to them, <font color="red">“How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him ‘Lord’? For he says,</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_44">  <sup>44</sup><font color="red">“ ‘The Lord said to my Lord:</font><br/>   <font color="red">“Sit at my right hand</font><br/>  <font color="red">until I put your enemies</font><br/>   <font color="red">under your feet.” ’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 22:44 Psalm 110:1 ">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_45"><sup>45</sup><font color="red">If then David calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?”</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_46"><sup>46</sup>No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions. <br/></span>
