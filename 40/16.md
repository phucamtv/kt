<div class="title"><h1>16</h1><h3>The Demand for a Sign </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_16_1"> <sup>1</sup>The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_2"> <sup>2</sup>He replied, <font color="red">“When evening comes, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red,’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">and in the morning, ‘Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some early manuscripts do not have When evening comes … of the times.">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.”</font> Jesus then left them and went away. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_16_5"> <sup>5</sup>When they went across the lake, the disciples forgot to take bread. </span>
<span class="verse mat_16_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">“Be careful,”</font> Jesus said to them. <font color="red">“Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_7"> <sup>7</sup>They discussed this among themselves and said, “It is because we didn’t bring any bread.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_8"> <sup>8</sup>Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, <font color="red">“You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">Do you still not understand? Don’t you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">How is it you don’t understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_12"><sup>12</sup>Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Peter Declares That Jesus Is the Messiah </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_16_13"> <sup>13</sup>When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, <font color="red">“Who do people say the Son of Man is?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_14"> <sup>14</sup>They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_15"> <sup>15</sup><font color="red">“But what about you?”</font> he asked. <font color="red">“Who do you say I am?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_16"> <sup>16</sup>Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_17"> <sup>17</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">And I tell you that you are Peter,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek word for Peter means rock.">⚓</a><font color="red">and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, the realm of the dead">⚓</a><font color="red">will not overcome it.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or will have been">⚓</a><font color="red">bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or will have been">⚓</a><font color="red">loosed in heaven.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_20"><sup>20</sup>Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Predicts His Death </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_16_21"> <sup>21</sup>From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_22"> <sup>22</sup>Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. “Never, Lord!” he said. “This shall never happen to you!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_23"> <sup>23</sup>Jesus turned and said to Peter, <font color="red">“Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_24"> <sup>24</sup>Then Jesus said to his disciples, <font color="red">“Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">For whoever wants to save their life</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Greek word means either life or soul ; also in verse 26.">⚓</a><font color="red">will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father’s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_28"> <sup>28</sup><font color="red">“Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”</font><br/></span>
