<div class="title"><h1>7</h1><h3>Judging Others </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_7_1"> <sup>1</sup><font color="red">“Do not judge, or you too will be judged.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_2"><sup>2</sup><font color="red">For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_3"> <sup>3</sup><font color="red">“Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_6"> <sup>6</sup><font color="red">“Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Ask, Seek, Knock </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_7_7"> <sup>7</sup><font color="red">“Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_9"> <sup>9</sup><font color="red">“Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Narrow and Wide Gates </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_7_13"> <sup>13</sup><font color="red">“Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>True and False Prophets </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_7_15"> <sup>15</sup><font color="red">“Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>True and False Disciples </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_7_21"> <sup>21</sup><font color="red">“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Wise and Foolish Builders </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_7_24"> <sup>24</sup><font color="red">“Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_7_28"> <sup>28</sup>When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, </span>
<span class="verse mat_7_29"><sup>29</sup>because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law. <br/></span>
