<div class="title"><h1>15</h1><h3>That Which Defiles </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_15_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked, </span>
<span class="verse mat_15_2"><sup>2</sup>“Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don’t wash their hands before they eat!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_3"> <sup>3</sup>Jesus replied, <font color="red">“And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Exodus 20:12; Deut. 5:16">⚓</a><font color="red">and ‘Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Exodus 21:17; Lev. 20:9">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is ‘devoted to God,’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">they are not to ‘honor their father or mother’ with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_8">  <sup>8</sup><font color="red">“ ‘These people honor me with their lips, </font><br/>   <font color="red">but their hearts are far from me.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_9">  <sup>9</sup><font color="red">They worship me in vain; </font><br/>   <font color="red">their teachings are merely human rules.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 15:9 Isaiah 29:13 ">⚓</a><font color="red">”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_10"> <sup>10</sup>Jesus called the crowd to him and said, <font color="red">“Listen and understand.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">What goes into someone’s mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then the disciples came to him and asked, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_13"> <sup>13</sup>He replied, <font color="red">“Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">Leave them; they are blind guides.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts blind guides of the blind">⚓</a><font color="red">If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_15"> <sup>15</sup>Peter said, “Explain the parable to us.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_16"> <sup>16</sup><font color="red">“Are you still so dull?”</font> Jesus asked them. </span>
<span class="verse mat_15_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">“Don’t you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">But the things that come out of a person’s mouth come from the heart, and these defile them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">For out of the heart come evil thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Faith of a Canaanite Woman </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_15_21"> <sup>21</sup>Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon. </span>
<span class="verse mat_15_22"><sup>22</sup>A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_23"> <sup>23</sup>Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_24"> <sup>24</sup>He answered, <font color="red">“I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_25"> <sup>25</sup>The woman came and knelt before him. “Lord, help me!” she said. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_26"> <sup>26</sup>He replied, <font color="red">“It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_27"> <sup>27</sup>“Yes it is, Lord,” she said. “Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_28"> <sup>28</sup>Then Jesus said to her, <font color="red">“Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.”</font> And her daughter was healed at that moment. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_15_29"> <sup>29</sup>Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down. </span>
<span class="verse mat_15_30"><sup>30</sup>Great crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them. </span>
<span class="verse mat_15_31"><sup>31</sup>The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_32"> <sup>32</sup>Jesus called his disciples to him and said, <font color="red">“I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_33"> <sup>33</sup>His disciples answered, “Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_34"> <sup>34</sup><font color="red">“How many loaves do you have?”</font> Jesus asked. <br/> “Seven,” they replied, “and a few small fish.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_35"> <sup>35</sup>He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. </span>
<span class="verse mat_15_36"><sup>36</sup>Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people. </span>
<span class="verse mat_15_37"><sup>37</sup>They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. </span>
<span class="verse mat_15_38"><sup>38</sup>The number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children. </span>
<span class="verse mat_15_39"><sup>39</sup>After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan. <br/></span>
