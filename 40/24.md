<div class="title"><h1>24</h1><h3>The Destruction of the Temple and Signs of the End Times </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_24_1"> <sup>1</sup>Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings. </span>
<span class="verse mat_24_2"><sup>2</sup><font color="red">“Do you see all these things?”</font> he asked. <font color="red">“Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_3"> <sup>3</sup>As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_4"> <sup>4</sup>Jesus answered: <font color="red">“Watch out that no one deceives you.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">All these are the beginning of birth pains.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_9"> <sup>9</sup><font color="red">“Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other,</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold,</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_15"> <sup>15</sup><font color="red">“So when you see standing in the holy place ‘the abomination that causes desolation,’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 24:15 Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11 ">⚓</a><font color="red">spoken of through the prophet Daniel—let the reader understand—</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_22"> <sup>22</sup><font color="red">“If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">At that time if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or, ‘There he is!’ do not believe it.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">See, I have told you ahead of time.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_26"> <sup>26</sup><font color="red">“So if anyone tells you, ‘There he is, out in the wilderness,’ do not go out; or, ‘Here he is, in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_28"><sup>28</sup><font color="red">Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_29"> <sup>29</sup><font color="red">“Immediately after the distress of those days </font><br/>  <font color="red">“ ‘the sun will be darkened, </font><br/>   <font color="red">and the moon will not give its light; </font><br/>  <font color="red">the stars will fall from the sky, </font><br/>   <font color="red">and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 24:29 Isaiah 13:10; 34:4 ">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_30"> <sup>30</sup><font color="red">“Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 24:30 Or  the tribes of the land ">⚓</a><font color="red">will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="See Daniel 7:13-14.">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_32"> <sup>32</sup><font color="red">“Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_33"><sup>33</sup><font color="red">Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or he">⚓</a><font color="red">is near, right at the door.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_34"><sup>34</sup><font color="red">Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Day and Hour Unknown </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_24_36"> <sup>36</sup><font color="red">“But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 24:36 Some manuscripts do not have  nor the Son. ">⚓</a><font color="red">but only the Father.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_37"><sup>37</sup><font color="red">As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_38"><sup>38</sup><font color="red">For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark;</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_39"><sup>39</sup><font color="red">and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_40"><sup>40</sup><font color="red">Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_41"><sup>41</sup><font color="red">Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_42"> <sup>42</sup><font color="red">“Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_43"><sup>43</sup><font color="red">But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_44"><sup>44</sup><font color="red">So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_45"> <sup>45</sup><font color="red">“Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_46"><sup>46</sup><font color="red">It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_47"><sup>47</sup><font color="red">Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_48"><sup>48</sup><font color="red">But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, ‘My master is staying away a long time,’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_49"><sup>49</sup><font color="red">and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_50"><sup>50</sup><font color="red">The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_24_51"><sup>51</sup><font color="red">He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</font><br/></span>
