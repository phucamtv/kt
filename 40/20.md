<div class="title"><h1>20</h1><h3>The Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_20_1"> <sup>1</sup><font color="red">“For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_2"><sup>2</sup><font color="red">He agreed to pay them a denarius</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="A denarius was the usual daily wage of a day laborer.">⚓</a><font color="red">for the day and sent them into his vineyard.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_3"> <sup>3</sup><font color="red">“About nine in the morning he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">He told them, ‘You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">So they went. </font><br/> <font color="red">“He went out again about noon and about three in the afternoon and did the same thing.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">About five in the afternoon he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, ‘Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_7"> <sup>7</sup><font color="red">“ ‘Because no one has hired us,’ they answered. </font><br/> <font color="red">“He said to them, ‘You also go and work in my vineyard.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_8"> <sup>8</sup><font color="red">“When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_9"> <sup>9</sup><font color="red">“The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">‘These who were hired last worked only one hour,’ they said, ‘and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_13"> <sup>13</sup><font color="red">“But he answered one of them, ‘I am not being unfair to you, friend. Didn’t you agree to work for a denarius?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">Don’t I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_16"> <sup>16</sup><font color="red">“So the last will be first, and the first will be last.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Predicts His Death a Third Time </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_20_17"> <sup>17</sup>Now Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the Twelve aside and said to them, </span>
<span class="verse mat_20_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">“We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">and will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. On the third day he will be raised to life!”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Mother’s Request </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_20_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling down, asked a favor of him. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_21"> <sup>21</sup><font color="red">“What is it you want?”</font> he asked. <br/> She said, “Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_22"> <sup>22</sup><font color="red">“You don’t know what you are asking,”</font> Jesus said to them. <font color="red">“Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?”</font><br/> “We can,” they answered. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_23"> <sup>23</sup>Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_24"> <sup>24</sup>When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers. </span>
<span class="verse mat_20_25"><sup>25</sup>Jesus called them together and said, <font color="red">“You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">and whoever wants to be first must be your slave—</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_28"><sup>28</sup><font color="red">just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Two Blind Men Receive Sight </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_20_29"> <sup>29</sup>As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him. </span>
<span class="verse mat_20_30"><sup>30</sup>Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was going by, they shouted, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_31"> <sup>31</sup>The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the louder, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_32"> <sup>32</sup>Jesus stopped and called them. <font color="red">“What do you want me to do for you?”</font> he asked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_33"> <sup>33</sup>“Lord,” they answered, “we want our sight.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_34"> <sup>34</sup>Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him. <br/></span>
