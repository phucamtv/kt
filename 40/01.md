<div class="title"><h3>Joseph Accepts Jesus as His Son </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_1_18"> <sup>18</sup>This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or The origin of Jesus the Messiah was like this">⚓</a> : His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. </span>
<span class="verse mat_1_19"><sup>19</sup>Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, and yet<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or was a righteous man and">⚓</a> did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_1_20"> <sup>20</sup>But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. </span>
<span class="verse mat_1_21"><sup>21</sup>She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="is the Greek form of Joshua, which means the Lordsaves.">⚓</a> because he will save his people from their sins.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_1_22"> <sup>22</sup>All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: </span>
<span class="verse mat_1_23"><sup>23</sup>“The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Isaiah 7:14">⚓</a> (which means “God with us”). <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_1_24"> <sup>24</sup>When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. </span>
<span class="verse mat_1_25"><sup>25</sup>But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus. <br/></span>
