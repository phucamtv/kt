<div class="title"><h1>23</h1><h3>A Warning Against Hypocrisy </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_23_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: </span>
<span class="verse mat_23_2"><sup>2</sup><font color="red">“The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_5"> <sup>5</sup><font color="red">“Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 23:5 That is, boxes containing Scripture verses, worn on forehead and arm ">⚓</a><font color="red">wide and the tassels on their garments long;</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues;</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by others.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_8"> <sup>8</sup><font color="red">“But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">The greatest among you will be your servant.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Seven Woes on the Teachers of the Law and the Pharisees </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_23_13"> <sup>13</sup><font color="red">“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_14"><sup>[14]</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 23:14 Some manuscripts include here words similar to Mark 12:40 and Luke 20:47. ">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_15"> <sup>15</sup><font color="red">“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_16"> <sup>16</sup><font color="red">“Woe to you, blind guides! You say, ‘If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gold of the temple is bound by that oath.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">You also say, ‘If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gift on the altar is bound by that oath.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">You blind men! Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">Therefore, anyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">And anyone who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">And anyone who swears by heaven swears by God’s throne and by the one who sits on it.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_23"> <sup>23</sup><font color="red">“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_25"> <sup>25</sup><font color="red">“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_27"> <sup>27</sup><font color="red">“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_28"><sup>28</sup><font color="red">In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_29"> <sup>29</sup><font color="red">“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">And you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">Go ahead, then, and complete what your ancestors started!</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_33"> <sup>33</sup><font color="red">“You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_34"><sup>34</sup><font color="red">Therefore I am sending you prophets and sages and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_36"><sup>36</sup><font color="red">Truly I tell you, all this will come on this generation.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_37"> <sup>37</sup><font color="red">“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_38"><sup>38</sup><font color="red">Look, your house is left to you desolate.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_23_39"><sup>39</sup><font color="red">For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 118:26">⚓</a><font color="red">”</font><br/></span>
