<div class="title"><h1>18</h1><h3>The Greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_18_1"> <sup>1</sup>At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who, then, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_2"> <sup>2</sup>He called a little child to him, and placed the child among them. </span>
<span class="verse mat_18_3"><sup>3</sup>And he said: <font color="red">“Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Causing to Stumble </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_18_6"> <sup>6</sup><font color="red">“If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble! Such things must come, but woe to the person through whom they come!</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Wandering Sheep </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_18_10"> <sup>10</sup><font color="red">“See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_11"><sup>[11]</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 18:11 Some manuscripts include here the words of Luke 19:10. ">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_12"> <sup>12</sup><font color="red">“What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Dealing With Sin in the Church </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_18_15"> <sup>15</sup><font color="red">“If your brother or sister</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 18:15 The Greek word for  brother or sister ( adelphos ) refers here to a fellow disciple, whether man or woman; also in verses 21 and 35. ">⚓</a><font color="red">sins,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some manuscripts sins against you">⚓</a><font color="red">go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that ‘every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 19:15">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_18"> <sup>18</sup><font color="red">“Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 18:18 Or  will have been ">⚓</a><font color="red">bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or will have been">⚓</a><font color="red">loosed in heaven.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_19"> <sup>19</sup><font color="red">“Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Unmerciful Servant </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_18_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_22"> <sup>22</sup>Jesus answered, <font color="red">“I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or seventy times seven">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_23"> <sup>23</sup><font color="red">“Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Greek ten thousand talents ; a talent was worth about 20 years of a day laborer’s wages.">⚓</a><font color="red">was brought to him.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_26"> <sup>26</sup><font color="red">“At this the servant fell on his knees before him. ‘Be patient with me,’ he begged, ‘and I will pay back everything.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">The servant’s master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_28"> <sup>28</sup><font color="red">“But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 18:28 Greek  a hundred denarii ; a denarius was the usual daily wage of a day laborer (see 20:2). ">⚓</a><font color="red">He grabbed him and began to choke him. ‘Pay back what you owe me!’ he demanded.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_29"> <sup>29</sup><font color="red">“His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_30"> <sup>30</sup><font color="red">“But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">When the other servants saw what had happened, they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_32"> <sup>32</sup><font color="red">“Then the master called the servant in. ‘You wicked servant,’ he said, ‘I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_33"><sup>33</sup><font color="red">Shouldn’t you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_34"><sup>34</sup><font color="red">In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_35"> <sup>35</sup><font color="red">“This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.”</font><br/></span>
