<div class="title"><h1>13</h1><h3>The Parable of the Sower </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_13_1"> <sup>1</sup>That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. </span>
<span class="verse mat_13_2"><sup>2</sup>Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. </span>
<span class="verse mat_13_3"><sup>3</sup>Then he told them many things in parables, saying: <font color="red">“A farmer went out to sow his seed.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">Whoever has ears, let them hear.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_10"> <sup>10</sup>The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_11"> <sup>11</sup>He replied, <font color="red">“Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">This is why I speak to them in parables: </font><br/>  <font color="red">“Though seeing, they do not see; </font><br/>   <font color="red">though hearing, they do not hear or understand.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: </font><br/>  <font color="red">“ ‘You will be ever hearing but never understanding; </font><br/>   <font color="red">you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_15">  <sup>15</sup><font color="red">For this people’s heart has become calloused; </font><br/>   <font color="red">they hardly hear with their ears,</font><br/>   <font color="red">and they have closed their eyes.</font><br/>  <font color="red">Otherwise they might see with their eyes,</font><br/>   <font color="red">hear with their ears,</font><br/>   <font color="red">understand with their hearts</font><br/>  <font color="red">and turn, and I would heal them.’</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title=" 13:15 Isaiah 6:9,10 (see Septuagint) ">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_18"> <sup>18</sup><font color="red">“Listen then to what the parable of the sower means:</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Weeds </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_13_24"> <sup>24</sup>Jesus told them another parable: <font color="red">“The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_27"> <sup>27</sup><font color="red">“The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_28"> <sup>28</sup><font color="red">“ ‘An enemy did this,’ he replied. </font><br/> <font color="red">“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_29"> <sup>29</sup><font color="red">“ ‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’ ”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_13_31"> <sup>31</sup>He told them another parable: <font color="red">“The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_33"> <sup>33</sup>He told them still another parable: <font color="red">“The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or about 27 kilograms">⚓</a><font color="red">of flour until it worked all through the dough.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_34"> <sup>34</sup>Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. </span>
<span class="verse mat_13_35"><sup>35</sup>So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: <br/>  “I will open my mouth in parables, <br/>   I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Psalm 78:2">⚓</a><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Weeds Explained </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_13_36"> <sup>36</sup>Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_37"> <sup>37</sup>He answered, <font color="red">“The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_38"><sup>38</sup><font color="red">The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one,</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_39"><sup>39</sup><font color="red">and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_40"> <sup>40</sup><font color="red">“As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_41"><sup>41</sup><font color="red">The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_42"><sup>42</sup><font color="red">They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_43"><sup>43</sup><font color="red">Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parables of the Hidden Treasure and the Pearl </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_13_44"> <sup>44</sup><font color="red">“The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_45"> <sup>45</sup><font color="red">“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_46"><sup>46</sup><font color="red">When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Net </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_13_47"> <sup>47</sup><font color="red">“Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_48"><sup>48</sup><font color="red">When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_49"><sup>49</sup><font color="red">This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_50"><sup>50</sup><font color="red">and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_51"> <sup>51</sup><font color="red">“Have you understood all these things?”</font> Jesus asked. <br/> “Yes,” they replied. <br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_52"> <sup>52</sup>He said to them, <font color="red">“Therefore every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Prophet Without Honor </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_13_53"> <sup>53</sup>When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there. </span>
<span class="verse mat_13_54"><sup>54</sup>Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. “Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?” they asked. </span>
<span class="verse mat_13_55"><sup>55</sup>“Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother’s name Mary, and aren’t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas? </span>
<span class="verse mat_13_56"><sup>56</sup>Aren’t all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?” </span>
<span class="verse mat_13_57"><sup>57</sup>And they took offense at him. <br/> But Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_58"> <sup>58</sup>And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith. <br/></span>
