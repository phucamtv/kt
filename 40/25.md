<div class="title"><h1>25</h1><h3>The Parable of the Ten Virgins </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_25_1"> <sup>1</sup><font color="red">“At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_2"><sup>2</sup><font color="red">Five of them were foolish and five were wise.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">The wise ones, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_6"> <sup>6</sup><font color="red">“At midnight the cry rang out: ‘Here’s the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_7"> <sup>7</sup><font color="red">“Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_9"> <sup>9</sup><font color="red">“ ‘No,’ they replied, ‘there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_10"> <sup>10</sup><font color="red">“But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_11"> <sup>11</sup><font color="red">“Later the others also came. ‘Lord, Lord,’ they said, ‘open the door for us!’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_12"> <sup>12</sup><font color="red">“But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I don’t know you.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_13"> <sup>13</sup><font color="red">“Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Bags of Gold </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_25_14"> <sup>14</sup><font color="red">“Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Greek five talents … two talents … one talent ; also throughout this parable; a talent was worth about 20 years of a day laborer’s wage.">⚓</a><font color="red">each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_19"> <sup>19</sup><font color="red">“After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_21"> <sup>21</sup><font color="red">“His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_22"> <sup>22</sup><font color="red">“The man with two bags of gold also came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_23"> <sup>23</sup><font color="red">“His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_24"> <sup>24</sup><font color="red">“Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_26"> <sup>26</sup><font color="red">“His master replied, ‘You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_28"> <sup>28</sup><font color="red">“ ‘So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Sheep and the Goats </h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_25_31"> <sup>31</sup><font color="red">“When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_33"><sup>33</sup><font color="red">He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_34"> <sup>34</sup><font color="red">“Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in,</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_36"><sup>36</sup><font color="red">I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_37"> <sup>37</sup><font color="red">“Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_38"><sup>38</sup><font color="red">When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_39"><sup>39</sup><font color="red">When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_40"> <sup>40</sup><font color="red">“The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_41"> <sup>41</sup><font color="red">“Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_42"><sup>42</sup><font color="red">For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink,</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_43"><sup>43</sup><font color="red">I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_44"> <sup>44</sup><font color="red">“They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_45"> <sup>45</sup><font color="red">“He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_25_46"> <sup>46</sup><font color="red">“Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.”</font><br/></span>
