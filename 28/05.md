<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>Judgment Against Israel </h3></div>
<span class="verse os_5_1">  <sup>1</sup>“Hear this, you priests! <br/>   Pay attention, you Israelites! <br/>  Listen, royal house! <br/>   This judgment is against you: <br/>  You have been a snare at Mizpah, <br/>   a net spread out on Tabor. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_5_2">  <sup>2</sup>The rebels are knee-deep in slaughter. <br/>   I will discipline all of them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_5_3">  <sup>3</sup>I know all about Ephraim; <br/>   Israel is not hidden from me. <br/>  Ephraim, you have now turned to prostitution; <br/>   Israel is corrupt. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_5_4">  <sup>4</sup>“Their deeds do not permit them <br/>   to return to their God. <br/>  A spirit of prostitution is in their heart; <br/>   they do not acknowledge the Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_5_5">  <sup>5</sup>Israel’s arrogance testifies against them; <br/>   the Israelites, even Ephraim, stumble in their sin; <br/>   Judah also stumbles with them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_5_6">  <sup>6</sup>When they go with their flocks and herds <br/>   to seek the Lord, <br/>  they will not find him; <br/>   he has withdrawn himself from them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_5_7">  <sup>7</sup>They are unfaithful to the Lord; <br/>   they give birth to illegitimate children. <br/>  When they celebrate their New Moon feasts, <br/>   he will devour<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Now their New Moon feasts / will devour them and">⚓</a> their fields. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_5_8">  <sup>8</sup>“Sound the trumpet in Gibeah, <br/>   the horn in Ramah. <br/>  Raise the battle cry in Beth Aven<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means house of wickedness (a derogatory name for Bethel, which means house of God ).">⚓</a> ; <br/>   lead on, Benjamin. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_5_9">  <sup>9</sup>Ephraim will be laid waste <br/>   on the day of reckoning. <br/>  Among the tribes of Israel <br/>   I proclaim what is certain. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_5_10">  <sup>10</sup>Judah’s leaders are like those <br/>   who move boundary stones. <br/>  I will pour out my wrath on them <br/>   like a flood of water. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_5_11">  <sup>11</sup>Ephraim is oppressed, <br/>   trampled in judgment, <br/>   intent on pursuing idols.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_5_12">  <sup>12</sup>I am like a moth to Ephraim, <br/>   like rot to the people of Judah. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_5_13">  <sup>13</sup>“When Ephraim saw his sickness, <br/>   and Judah his sores, <br/>  then Ephraim turned to Assyria, <br/>   and sent to the great king for help. <br/>  But he is not able to cure you, <br/>   not able to heal your sores. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_5_14">  <sup>14</sup>For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, <br/>   like a great lion to Judah. <br/>  I will tear them to pieces and go away; <br/>   I will carry them off, with no one to rescue them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_5_15">  <sup>15</sup>Then I will return to my lair <br/>   until they have borne their guilt <br/>   and seek my face— <br/>  in their misery <br/>   they will earnestly seek me.” <br/></span>
