<div class="title"><h1>14</h1><h3>Repentance to Bring Blessing </h3></div>
<span class="verse os_14_1">  <sup>1</sup>Return, Israel, to the Lord your God. <br/>   Your sins have been your downfall! <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_14_2">  <sup>2</sup>Take words with you <br/>   and return to the Lord. <br/>  Say to him: <br/>   “Forgive all our sins <br/>  and receive us graciously, <br/>   that we may offer the fruit of our lips.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or offer our lips as sacrifices of bulls">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_14_3">  <sup>3</sup>Assyria cannot save us; <br/>   we will not mount warhorses. <br/>  We will never again say ‘Our gods’ <br/>   to what our own hands have made, <br/>   for in you the fatherless find compassion.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_14_4">  <sup>4</sup>“I will heal their waywardness <br/>   and love them freely, <br/>   for my anger has turned away from them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_14_5">  <sup>5</sup>I will be like the dew to Israel; <br/>   he will blossom like a lily. <br/>  Like a cedar of Lebanon <br/>   he will send down his roots; <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_14_6">   <sup>6</sup>his young shoots will grow. <br/>  His splendor will be like an olive tree, <br/>   his fragrance like a cedar of Lebanon. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_14_7">  <sup>7</sup>People will dwell again in his shade; <br/>   they will flourish like the grain, <br/>  they will blossom like the vine— <br/>   Israel’s fame will be like the wine of Lebanon. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_14_8">  <sup>8</sup>Ephraim, what more have I<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Hebrew; Septuagint What more has Ephraim">⚓</a> to do with idols? <br/>   I will answer him and care for him. <br/>  I am like a flourishing juniper; <br/>   your fruitfulness comes from me.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_14_9">  <sup>9</sup>Who is wise? Let them realize these things. <br/>   Who is discerning? Let them understand. <br/>  The ways of the Lord are right; <br/>   the righteous walk in them, <br/>   but the rebellious stumble in them. <br/></span>
