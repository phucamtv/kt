<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>The Charge Against Israel </h3></div>
<span class="verse os_4_1">  <sup>1</sup>Hear the word of the Lord, you Israelites, <br/>   because the Lord has a charge to bring <br/>   against you who live in the land: <br/>  “There is no faithfulness, no love, <br/>   no acknowledgment of God in the land. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_4_2">  <sup>2</sup>There is only cursing,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, to pronounce a curse on">⚓</a> lying and murder, <br/>   stealing and adultery; <br/>  they break all bounds, <br/>   and bloodshed follows bloodshed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_4_3">  <sup>3</sup>Because of this the land dries up, <br/>   and all who live in it waste away; <br/>  the beasts of the field, the birds in the sky <br/>   and the fish in the sea are swept away. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_4_4">  <sup>4</sup>“But let no one bring a charge, <br/>   let no one accuse another, <br/>  for your people are like those <br/>   who bring charges against a priest. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_4_5">  <sup>5</sup>You stumble day and night, <br/>   and the prophets stumble with you. <br/>  So I will destroy your mother— <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_4_6">   <sup>6</sup>my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. <br/><br/>  “Because you have rejected knowledge, <br/>   I also reject you as my priests; <br/>  because you have ignored the law of your God, <br/>   I also will ignore your children. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_4_7">  <sup>7</sup>The more priests there were, <br/>   the more they sinned against me; <br/>   they exchanged their glorious God<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Syriac (see also an ancient Hebrew scribal tradition); Masoretic Text me; / I will exchange their glory">⚓</a> for something disgraceful. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_4_8">  <sup>8</sup>They feed on the sins of my people <br/>   and relish their wickedness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_4_9">  <sup>9</sup>And it will be: Like people, like priests. <br/>   I will punish both of them for their ways <br/>   and repay them for their deeds. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_4_10">  <sup>10</sup>“They will eat but not have enough; <br/>   they will engage in prostitution but not flourish, <br/>  because they have deserted the Lord<br/>   to give themselves </span>
<span class="verse os_4_11">   <sup>11</sup>to prostitution; <br/>  old wine and new wine <br/>   take away their understanding. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_4_12">  <sup>12</sup>My people consult a wooden idol, <br/>   and a diviner’s rod speaks to them. <br/>  A spirit of prostitution leads them astray; <br/>   they are unfaithful to their God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_4_13">  <sup>13</sup>They sacrifice on the mountaintops <br/>   and burn offerings on the hills, <br/>  under oak, poplar and terebinth, <br/>   where the shade is pleasant. <br/>  Therefore your daughters turn to prostitution <br/>   and your daughters-in-law to adultery. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_4_14">  <sup>14</sup>“I will not punish your daughters <br/>   when they turn to prostitution, <br/>  nor your daughters-in-law <br/>   when they commit adultery, <br/>  because the men themselves consort with harlots <br/>   and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes— <br/>   a people without understanding will come to ruin! <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_4_15">  <sup>15</sup>“Though you, Israel, commit adultery, <br/>   do not let Judah become guilty. <br/><br/>  “Do not go to Gilgal; <br/>   do not go up to Beth Aven.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means house of wickedness (a derogatory name for Bethel, which means house of God ).">⚓</a><br/>   And do not swear, ‘As surely as the Lord lives!’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_4_16">  <sup>16</sup>The Israelites are stubborn, <br/>   like a stubborn heifer. <br/>  How then can the Lord pasture them <br/>   like lambs in a meadow? <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_4_17">  <sup>17</sup>Ephraim is joined to idols; <br/>   leave him alone! <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_4_18">  <sup>18</sup>Even when their drinks are gone, <br/>   they continue their prostitution; <br/>   their rulers dearly love shameful ways. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_4_19">  <sup>19</sup>A whirlwind will sweep them away, <br/>   and their sacrifices will bring them shame. <br/></span>
