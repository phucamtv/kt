<div class="title"><h1>13</h1><h3>The Lord’s Anger Against Israel </h3></div>
<span class="verse os_13_1">  <sup>1</sup>When Ephraim spoke, people trembled; <br/>   he was exalted in Israel. <br/>   But he became guilty of Baal worship and died. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_13_2">  <sup>2</sup>Now they sin more and more; <br/>   they make idols for themselves from their silver, <br/>  cleverly fashioned images, <br/>   all of them the work of craftsmen. <br/>  It is said of these people, <br/>   “They offer human sacrifices! <br/>   They kiss<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or “Men who sacrifice / kiss">⚓</a> calf-idols!” <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_13_3">  <sup>3</sup>Therefore they will be like the morning mist, <br/>   like the early dew that disappears, <br/>   like chaff swirling from a threshing floor, <br/>   like smoke escaping through a window. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_13_4">  <sup>4</sup>“But I have been the Lord your God <br/>   ever since you came out of Egypt. <br/>  You shall acknowledge no God but me, <br/>   no Savior except me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_13_5">  <sup>5</sup>I cared for you in the wilderness, <br/>   in the land of burning heat. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_13_6">  <sup>6</sup>When I fed them, they were satisfied; <br/>   when they were satisfied, they became proud; <br/>   then they forgot me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_13_7">  <sup>7</sup>So I will be like a lion to them, <br/>   like a leopard I will lurk by the path. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_13_8">  <sup>8</sup>Like a bear robbed of her cubs, <br/>   I will attack them and rip them open; <br/>  like a lion I will devour them— <br/>   a wild animal will tear them apart. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_13_9">  <sup>9</sup>“You are destroyed, Israel, <br/>   because you are against me, against your helper. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_13_10">  <sup>10</sup>Where is your king, that he may save you? <br/>   Where are your rulers in all your towns, <br/>  of whom you said, <br/>   ‘Give me a king and princes’? <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_13_11">  <sup>11</sup>So in my anger I gave you a king, <br/>   and in my wrath I took him away. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_13_12">  <sup>12</sup>The guilt of Ephraim is stored up, <br/>   his sins are kept on record. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_13_13">  <sup>13</sup>Pains as of a woman in childbirth come to him, <br/>   but he is a child without wisdom; <br/>  when the time arrives, <br/>   he doesn’t have the sense to come out of the womb. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_13_14">  <sup>14</sup>“I will deliver this people from the power of the grave; <br/>   I will redeem them from death. <br/>  Where, O death, are your plagues? <br/>   Where, O grave, is your destruction? <br/><br/>  “I will have no compassion, <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_13_15">   <sup>15</sup>even though he thrives among his brothers. <br/>  An east wind from the Lord will come, <br/>   blowing in from the desert; <br/>  his spring will fail <br/>   and his well dry up. <br/>  His storehouse will be plundered <br/>   of all its treasures. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_13_16">  <sup>16</sup>The people of Samaria must bear their guilt, <br/>   because they have rebelled against their God. <br/>  They will fall by the sword; <br/>   their little ones will be dashed to the ground, <br/>   their pregnant women ripped open.”<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="In Hebrew texts this verse (13:16) is numbered 14:1.">⚓</a><br/></span>
