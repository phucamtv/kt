<span class="verse os_6_1">  <sup>1</sup>“Come, let us return to the Lord. <br/>  He has torn us to pieces <br/>   but he will heal us; <br/>  he has injured us <br/>   but he will bind up our wounds. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_6_2">  <sup>2</sup>After two days he will revive us; <br/>   on the third day he will restore us, <br/>   that we may live in his presence. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_6_3">  <sup>3</sup>Let us acknowledge the Lord; <br/>   let us press on to acknowledge him. <br/>  As surely as the sun rises, <br/>   he will appear; <br/>  he will come to us like the winter rains, <br/>   like the spring rains that water the earth.” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_6_4">  <sup>4</sup>“What can I do with you, Ephraim? <br/>   What can I do with you, Judah? <br/>  Your love is like the morning mist, <br/>   like the early dew that disappears. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_6_5">  <sup>5</sup>Therefore I cut you in pieces with my prophets, <br/>   I killed you with the words of my mouth— <br/>   then my judgments go forth like the sun.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this line is uncertain.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_6_6">  <sup>6</sup>For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, <br/>   and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_6_7">  <sup>7</sup>As at Adam,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or Like Adam ; or Like human beings">⚓</a> they have broken the covenant; <br/>   they were unfaithful to me there. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_6_8">  <sup>8</sup>Gilead is a city of evildoers, <br/>   stained with footprints of blood. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_6_9">  <sup>9</sup>As marauders lie in ambush for a victim, <br/>   so do bands of priests; <br/>  they murder on the road to Shechem, <br/>   carrying out their wicked schemes. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_6_10">  <sup>10</sup>I have seen a horrible thing in Israel: <br/>   There Ephraim is given to prostitution, <br/>   Israel is defiled. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_6_11">  <sup>11</sup>“Also for you, Judah, <br/>   a harvest is appointed. <br/><br/>  “Whenever I would restore the fortunes of my people, <br/><br/></span>
