<div class="title"><h1>10</h1></div>
<span class="verse os_10_1">  <sup>1</sup>Israel was a spreading vine; <br/>   he brought forth fruit for himself. <br/>  As his fruit increased, <br/>   he built more altars; <br/>  as his land prospered, <br/>   he adorned his sacred stones. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_10_2">  <sup>2</sup>Their heart is deceitful, <br/>   and now they must bear their guilt. <br/>  The Lord will demolish their altars <br/>   and destroy their sacred stones. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_10_3">  <sup>3</sup>Then they will say, “We have no king <br/>   because we did not revere the Lord. <br/>  But even if we had a king, <br/>   what could he do for us?” <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_10_4">  <sup>4</sup>They make many promises, <br/>   take false oaths <br/>   and make agreements; <br/>  therefore lawsuits spring up <br/>   like poisonous weeds in a plowed field. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_10_5">  <sup>5</sup>The people who live in Samaria fear <br/>   for the calf-idol of Beth Aven.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means house of wickedness (a derogatory name for Bethel, which means house of God ).">⚓</a><br/>  Its people will mourn over it, <br/>   and so will its idolatrous priests, <br/>  those who had rejoiced over its splendor, <br/>   because it is taken from them into exile. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_10_6">  <sup>6</sup>It will be carried to Assyria <br/>   as tribute for the great king. <br/>  Ephraim will be disgraced; <br/>   Israel will be ashamed of its foreign alliances. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_10_7">  <sup>7</sup>Samaria’s king will be destroyed, <br/>   swept away like a twig on the surface of the waters. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_10_8">  <sup>8</sup>The high places of wickedness<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew aven, a reference to Beth Aven (a derogatory name for Bethel); see verse 5.">⚓</a> will be destroyed— <br/>   it is the sin of Israel. <br/>  Thorns and thistles will grow up <br/>   and cover their altars. <br/>  Then they will say to the mountains, “Cover us!” <br/>   and to the hills, “Fall on us!” <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_10_9">  <sup>9</sup>“Since the days of Gibeah, you have sinned, Israel, <br/>   and there you have remained.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or there a stand was taken">⚓</a><br/>  Will not war again overtake <br/>   the evildoers in Gibeah? <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_10_10">  <sup>10</sup>When I please, I will punish them; <br/>   nations will be gathered against them <br/>   to put them in bonds for their double sin. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_10_11">  <sup>11</sup>Ephraim is a trained heifer <br/>   that loves to thresh; <br/>  so I will put a yoke <br/>   on her fair neck. <br/>  I will drive Ephraim, <br/>   Judah must plow, <br/>   and Jacob must break up the ground. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_10_12">  <sup>12</sup>Sow righteousness for yourselves, <br/>   reap the fruit of unfailing love, <br/>  and break up your unplowed ground; <br/>   for it is time to seek the Lord, <br/>  until he comes <br/>   and showers his righteousness on you. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_10_13">  <sup>13</sup>But you have planted wickedness, <br/>   you have reaped evil, <br/>   you have eaten the fruit of deception. <br/>  Because you have depended on your own strength <br/>   and on your many warriors, <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_10_14">  <sup>14</sup>the roar of battle will rise against your people, <br/>   so that all your fortresses will be devastated— <br/>  as Shalman devastated Beth Arbel on the day of battle, <br/>   when mothers were dashed to the ground with their children. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_10_15">  <sup>15</sup>So will it happen to you, Bethel, <br/>   because your wickedness is great. <br/>  When that day dawns, <br/>   the king of Israel will be completely destroyed. <br/></span>
