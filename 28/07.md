<span class="verse os_7_1">  <sup>1</sup>whenever I would heal Israel, <br/>  the sins of Ephraim are exposed <br/>   and the crimes of Samaria revealed. <br/>  They practice deceit, <br/>   thieves break into houses, <br/>   bandits rob in the streets; <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_7_2">  <sup>2</sup>but they do not realize <br/>   that I remember all their evil deeds. <br/>  Their sins engulf them; <br/>   they are always before me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_7_3">  <sup>3</sup>“They delight the king with their wickedness, <br/>   the princes with their lies. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_7_4">  <sup>4</sup>They are all adulterers, <br/>   burning like an oven <br/>  whose fire the baker need not stir <br/>   from the kneading of the dough till it rises. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_7_5">  <sup>5</sup>On the day of the festival of our king <br/>   the princes become inflamed with wine, <br/>   and he joins hands with the mockers. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_7_6">  <sup>6</sup>Their hearts are like an oven; <br/>   they approach him with intrigue. <br/>  Their passion smolders all night; <br/>   in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_7_7">  <sup>7</sup>All of them are hot as an oven; <br/>   they devour their rulers. <br/>  All their kings fall, <br/>   and none of them calls on me. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_7_8">  <sup>8</sup>“Ephraim mixes with the nations; <br/>   Ephraim is a flat loaf not turned over. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_7_9">  <sup>9</sup>Foreigners sap his strength, <br/>   but he does not realize it. <br/>  His hair is sprinkled with gray, <br/>   but he does not notice. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_7_10">  <sup>10</sup>Israel’s arrogance testifies against him, <br/>   but despite all this <br/>  he does not return to the Lord his God <br/>   or search for him. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_7_11">  <sup>11</sup>“Ephraim is like a dove, <br/>   easily deceived and senseless— <br/>  now calling to Egypt, <br/>   now turning to Assyria. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_7_12">  <sup>12</sup>When they go, I will throw my net over them; <br/>   I will pull them down like the birds in the sky. <br/>  When I hear them flocking together, <br/>   I will catch them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_7_13">  <sup>13</sup>Woe to them, <br/>   because they have strayed from me! <br/>  Destruction to them, <br/>   because they have rebelled against me! <br/>  I long to redeem them <br/>   but they speak about me falsely. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_7_14">  <sup>14</sup>They do not cry out to me from their hearts <br/>   but wail on their beds. <br/>  They slash themselves,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Some Hebrew manuscripts and Septuagint; most Hebrew manuscripts They gather together">⚓</a> appealing to their gods <br/>   for grain and new wine, <br/>   but they turn away from me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_7_15">  <sup>15</sup>I trained them and strengthened their arms, <br/>   but they plot evil against me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_7_16">  <sup>16</sup>They do not turn to the Most High; <br/>   they are like a faulty bow. <br/>  Their leaders will fall by the sword <br/>   because of their insolent words. <br/>  For this they will be ridiculed <br/>   in the land of Egypt. <br/></span>
