<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>Hosea’s Reconciliation With His Wife </h3></div>
<span class="verse os_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>The Lord said to me, “Go, show your love to your wife again, though she is loved by another man and is an adulteress. Love her as the Lord loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_3_2"> <sup>2</sup>So I bought her for fifteen shekels<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 6 ounces or about 170 grams">⚓</a> of silver and about a homer and a lethek<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="A homer and a lethek possibly weighed about 430 pounds or about 195 kilograms.">⚓</a> of barley. </span>
<span class="verse os_3_3"><sup>3</sup>Then I told her, “You are to live with me many days; you must not be a prostitute or be intimate with any man, and I will behave the same way toward you.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_3_4"> <sup>4</sup>For the Israelites will live many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred stones, without ephod or household gods. </span>
<span class="verse os_3_5"><sup>5</sup>Afterward the Israelites will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king. They will come trembling to the Lord and to his blessings in the last days. <br/></span>
