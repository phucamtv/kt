<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>God’s Love for Israel </h3></div>
<span class="verse os_11_1">  <sup>1</sup>“When Israel was a child, I loved him, <br/>   and out of Egypt I called my son. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_11_2">  <sup>2</sup>But the more they were called, <br/>   the more they went away from me.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint; Hebrew them">⚓</a><br/>  They sacrificed to the Baals <br/>   and they burned incense to images. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_11_3">  <sup>3</sup>It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, <br/>   taking them by the arms; <br/>  but they did not realize <br/>   it was I who healed them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_11_4">  <sup>4</sup>I led them with cords of human kindness, <br/>   with ties of love. <br/>  To them I was like one who lifts <br/>   a little child to the cheek, <br/>   and I bent down to feed them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_11_5">  <sup>5</sup>“Will they not return to Egypt <br/>   and will not Assyria rule over them <br/>   because they refuse to repent? <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_11_6">  <sup>6</sup>A sword will flash in their cities; <br/>   it will devour their false prophets <br/>   and put an end to their plans. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_11_7">  <sup>7</sup>My people are determined to turn from me. <br/>   Even though they call me God Most High, <br/>   I will by no means exalt them. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_11_8">  <sup>8</sup>“How can I give you up, Ephraim? <br/>   How can I hand you over, Israel? <br/>  How can I treat you like Admah? <br/>   How can I make you like Zeboyim? <br/>  My heart is changed within me; <br/>   all my compassion is aroused. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_11_9">  <sup>9</sup>I will not carry out my fierce anger, <br/>   nor will I devastate Ephraim again. <br/>  For I am God, and not a man— <br/>   the Holy One among you. <br/>   I will not come against their cities. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_11_10">  <sup>10</sup>They will follow the Lord; <br/>   he will roar like a lion. <br/>  When he roars, <br/>   his children will come trembling from the west. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_11_11">  <sup>11</sup>They will come from Egypt, <br/>   trembling like sparrows, <br/>   from Assyria, fluttering like doves. <br/>  I will settle them in their homes,” <br/>   declares the Lord. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Israel’s Sin </h3></div>
<span class="verse os_11_12">  <sup>12</sup>Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, <br/>   Israel with deceit. <br/>  And Judah is unruly against God, <br/>   even against the faithful Holy One.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="In Hebrew texts this verse (11:12) is numbered 12:1.">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
