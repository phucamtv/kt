<span class="verse os_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>“Say of your brothers, ‘My people,’ and of your sisters, ‘My loved one.’ <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Israel Punished and Restored </h3></div>
<span class="verse os_2_2">  <sup>2</sup>“Rebuke your mother, rebuke her, <br/>   for she is not my wife, <br/>   and I am not her husband. <br/>  Let her remove the adulterous look from her face <br/>   and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_3">  <sup>3</sup>Otherwise I will strip her naked <br/>   and make her as bare as on the day she was born; <br/>  I will make her like a desert, <br/>   turn her into a parched land, <br/>   and slay her with thirst. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_4">  <sup>4</sup>I will not show my love to her children, <br/>   because they are the children of adultery. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_5">  <sup>5</sup>Their mother has been unfaithful <br/>   and has conceived them in disgrace. <br/>  She said, ‘I will go after my lovers, <br/>   who give me my food and my water, <br/>   my wool and my linen, my olive oil and my drink.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_6">  <sup>6</sup>Therefore I will block her path with thornbushes; <br/>   I will wall her in so that she cannot find her way. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_7">  <sup>7</sup>She will chase after her lovers but not catch them; <br/>   she will look for them but not find them. <br/>  Then she will say, <br/>   ‘I will go back to my husband as at first, <br/>   for then I was better off than now.’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_8">  <sup>8</sup>She has not acknowledged that I was the one <br/>   who gave her the grain, the new wine and oil, <br/>  who lavished on her the silver and gold— <br/>   which they used for Baal. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_9">  <sup>9</sup>“Therefore I will take away my grain when it ripens, <br/>   and my new wine when it is ready. <br/>  I will take back my wool and my linen, <br/>   intended to cover her naked body. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_10">  <sup>10</sup>So now I will expose her lewdness <br/>   before the eyes of her lovers; <br/>   no one will take her out of my hands. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_11">  <sup>11</sup>I will stop all her celebrations: <br/>   her yearly festivals, her New Moons, <br/>   her Sabbath days—all her appointed festivals. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_12">  <sup>12</sup>I will ruin her vines and her fig trees, <br/>   which she said were her pay from her lovers; <br/>  I will make them a thicket, <br/>   and wild animals will devour them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_13">  <sup>13</sup>I will punish her for the days <br/>   she burned incense to the Baals; <br/>  she decked herself with rings and jewelry, <br/>   and went after her lovers, <br/>   but me she forgot,” <br/> <aside style="text-align:right;">declares the Lord. </aside><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_14">  <sup>14</sup>“Therefore I am now going to allure her; <br/>   I will lead her into the wilderness <br/>   and speak tenderly to her. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_15">  <sup>15</sup>There I will give her back her vineyards, <br/>   and will make the Valley of Achor<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means trouble.">⚓</a> a door of hope. <br/>  There she will respond<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or sing">⚓</a> as in the days of her youth, <br/>   as in the day she came up out of Egypt. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_16">  <sup>16</sup>“In that day,” declares the Lord, <br/>   “you will call me ‘my husband’; <br/>   you will no longer call me ‘my master.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew baal">⚓</a> ’ <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_17">  <sup>17</sup>I will remove the names of the Baals from her lips; <br/>   no longer will their names be invoked. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_18">  <sup>18</sup>In that day I will make a covenant for them <br/>   with the beasts of the field, the birds in the sky <br/>   and the creatures that move along the ground. <br/>  Bow and sword and battle <br/>   I will abolish from the land, <br/>   so that all may lie down in safety. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_19">  <sup>19</sup>I will betroth you to me forever; <br/>   I will betroth you in<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or with ; also in verse 20">⚓</a> righteousness and justice, <br/>   in<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or with">⚓</a> love and compassion. <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_20">  <sup>20</sup>I will betroth you in faithfulness, <br/>   and you will acknowledge the Lord. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_21">  <sup>21</sup>“In that day I will respond,” <br/>   declares the Lord— <br/>  “I will respond to the skies, <br/>   and they will respond to the earth; <br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_22">  <sup>22</sup>and the earth will respond to the grain, <br/>   the new wine and the olive oil, <br/>   and they will respond to Jezreel.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="means God plants.">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse os_2_23">  <sup>23</sup>I will plant her for myself in the land; <br/>   I will show my love to the one I called ‘Not my loved one.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew Lo-Ruhamah (see 1:6)">⚓</a> ’ <br/>  I will say to those called ‘Not my people,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew Lo-Ammi (see 1:9)">⚓</a> ’ ‘You are my people’; <br/>   and they will say, ‘You are my God.’ ” <br/></span>
