<div class="title"><h1>15</h1><h3>Jerusalem as a Useless Vine </h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_15_1"> <sup>1</sup>The word of the Lord came to me: </span>
<span class="verse exe_15_2"><sup>2</sup>“Son of man, how is the wood of a vine different from that of a branch from any of the trees in the forest? </span>
<span class="verse exe_15_3"><sup>3</sup>Is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful? Do they make pegs from it to hang things on? </span>
<span class="verse exe_15_4"><sup>4</sup>And after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends and chars the middle, is it then useful for anything? </span>
<span class="verse exe_15_5"><sup>5</sup>If it was not useful for anything when it was whole, how much less can it be made into something useful when the fire has burned it and it is charred? <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_15_6"> <sup>6</sup>“Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: As I have given the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest as fuel for the fire, so will I treat the people living in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse exe_15_7"><sup>7</sup>I will set my face against them. Although they have come out of the fire, the fire will yet consume them. And when I set my face against them, you will know that I am the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse exe_15_8"><sup>8</sup>I will make the land desolate because they have been unfaithful, declares the Sovereign Lord.” <br/></span>
