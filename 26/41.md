<div class="title"><h1>41</h1><h3>The New Temple </h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_41_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then the man brought me to the main hall and measured the jambs; the width of the jambs was six cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 11 feet or about 3.2 meters; also in verses 3, 5 and 8">⚓</a> on each side.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="One Hebrew manuscript and Septuagint; most Hebrew manuscripts side, the width of the tent">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse exe_41_2"><sup>2</sup>The entrance was ten cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 18 feet or about 5.3 meters">⚓</a> wide, and the projecting walls on each side of it were five cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 8 3/4 feet or about 2.7 meters; also in verses 9, 11 and 12">⚓</a> wide. He also measured the main hall; it was forty cubits long and twenty cubits wide.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 70 feet long and 35 feet wide or about 21 meters long and 11 meters wide">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_41_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then he went into the inner sanctuary and measured the jambs of the entrance; each was two cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 3 1/2 feet or about 1.1 meters; also in verse 22">⚓</a> wide. The entrance was six cubits wide, and the projecting walls on each side of it were seven cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 12 feet or about 3.7 meters">⚓</a> wide. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_4"><sup>4</sup>And he measured the length of the inner sanctuary; it was twenty cubits, and its width was twenty cubits across the end of the main hall. He said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_41_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then he measured the wall of the temple; it was six cubits thick, and each side room around the temple was four cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 7 feet or about 2.1 meters">⚓</a> wide. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_6"><sup>6</sup>The side rooms were on three levels, one above another, thirty on each level. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side rooms, so that the supports were not inserted into the wall of the temple. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_7"><sup>7</sup>The side rooms all around the temple were wider at each successive level. The structure surrounding the temple was built in ascending stages, so that the rooms widened as one went upward. A stairway went up from the lowest floor to the top floor through the middle floor. <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_41_8"> <sup>8</sup>I saw that the temple had a raised base all around it, forming the foundation of the side rooms. It was the length of the rod, six long cubits. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_9"><sup>9</sup>The outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits thick. The open area between the side rooms of the temple </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_10"><sup>10</sup>and the priests’ rooms was twenty cubits wide all around the temple. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_11"><sup>11</sup>There were entrances to the side rooms from the open area, one on the north and another on the south; and the base adjoining the open area was five cubits wide all around. <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_41_12"> <sup>12</sup>The building facing the temple courtyard on the west side was seventy cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 123 feet or about 37 meters">⚓</a> wide. The wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length was ninety cubits.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 158 feet or about 48 meters">⚓</a><br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_41_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then he measured the temple; it was a hundred cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 175 feet or about 53 meters; also in verses 14 and 15">⚓</a> long, and the temple courtyard and the building with its walls were also a hundred cubits long. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_14"><sup>14</sup>The width of the temple courtyard on the east, including the front of the temple, was a hundred cubits. <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_41_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then he measured the length of the building facing the courtyard at the rear of the temple, including its galleries on each side; it was a hundred cubits. <br/> The main hall, the inner sanctuary and the portico facing the court, </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_16"><sup>16</sup>as well as the thresholds and the narrow windows and galleries around the three of them—everything beyond and including the threshold was covered with wood. The floor, the wall up to the windows, and the windows were covered. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_17"><sup>17</sup>In the space above the outside of the entrance to the inner sanctuary and on the walls at regular intervals all around the inner and outer sanctuary </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_18"><sup>18</sup>were carved cherubim and palm trees. Palm trees alternated with cherubim. Each cherub had two faces: </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_19"><sup>19</sup>the face of a human being toward the palm tree on one side and the face of a lion toward the palm tree on the other. They were carved all around the whole temple. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_20"><sup>20</sup>From the floor to the area above the entrance, cherubim and palm trees were carved on the wall of the main hall. <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_41_21"> <sup>21</sup>The main hall had a rectangular doorframe, and the one at the front of the Most Holy Place was similar. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_22"><sup>22</sup>There was a wooden altar three cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 5 1/4 feet or about 1.5 meters">⚓</a> high and two cubits square<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint; Hebrew long">⚓</a> ; its corners, its base<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint; Hebrew length">⚓</a> and its sides were of wood. The man said to me, “This is the table that is before the Lord.” </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_23"><sup>23</sup>Both the main hall and the Most Holy Place had double doors. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_24"><sup>24</sup>Each door had two leaves—two hinged leaves for each door. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_25"><sup>25</sup>And on the doors of the main hall were carved cherubim and palm trees like those carved on the walls, and there was a wooden overhang on the front of the portico. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_26"><sup>26</sup>On the sidewalls of the portico were narrow windows with palm trees carved on each side. The side rooms of the temple also had overhangs. <br/></span>
