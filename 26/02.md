<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Ezekiel’s Call to Be a Prophet </h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>He said to me, “Son of man,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The Hebrew phrase ben adam means human being . The phrase son of man is retained as a form of address here and throughout Ezekiel because of its possible association with “Son of Man” in the New Testament.">⚓</a> stand up on your feet and I will speak to you.” </span>
<span class="verse exe_2_2"><sup>2</sup>As he spoke, the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet, and I heard him speaking to me. <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_2_3"> <sup>3</sup>He said: “Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have been in revolt against me to this very day. </span>
<span class="verse exe_2_4"><sup>4</sup>The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn. Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says.’ </span>
<span class="verse exe_2_5"><sup>5</sup>And whether they listen or fail to listen—for they are a rebellious people—they will know that a prophet has been among them. </span>
<span class="verse exe_2_6"><sup>6</sup>And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions. Do not be afraid of what they say or be terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people. </span>
<span class="verse exe_2_7"><sup>7</sup>You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen, for they are rebellious. </span>
<span class="verse exe_2_8"><sup>8</sup>But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not rebel like that rebellious people; open your mouth and eat what I give you.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_2_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll, </span>
<span class="verse exe_2_10"><sup>10</sup>which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe. <br/></span>
