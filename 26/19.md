<div class="title"><h1>19</h1><h3>A Lament Over Israel’s Princes </h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_19_1"> <sup>1</sup>“Take up a lament concerning the princes of Israel </span>
<span class="verse exe_19_2"><sup>2</sup>and say: <br/>  “ ‘What a lioness was your mother <br/>   among the lions! <br/>  She lay down among them <br/>   and reared her cubs. <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_19_3">  <sup>3</sup>She brought up one of her cubs, <br/>   and he became a strong lion. <br/>  He learned to tear the prey <br/>   and he became a man-eater. <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_19_4">  <sup>4</sup>The nations heard about him, <br/>   and he was trapped in their pit. <br/>  They led him with hooks <br/>   to the land of Egypt. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_19_5">  <sup>5</sup>“ ‘When she saw her hope unfulfilled, <br/>   her expectation gone, <br/>  she took another of her cubs <br/>   and made him a strong lion. <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_19_6">  <sup>6</sup>He prowled among the lions, <br/>   for he was now a strong lion. <br/>  He learned to tear the prey <br/>   and he became a man-eater. <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_19_7">  <sup>7</sup>He broke down<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Targum (see Septuagint); Hebrew He knew">⚓</a> their strongholds <br/>   and devastated their towns. <br/>  The land and all who were in it <br/>   were terrified by his roaring. <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_19_8">  <sup>8</sup>Then the nations came against him, <br/>   those from regions round about. <br/>  They spread their net for him, <br/>   and he was trapped in their pit. <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_19_9">  <sup>9</sup>With hooks they pulled him into a cage <br/>   and brought him to the king of Babylon. <br/>  They put him in prison, <br/>   so his roar was heard no longer <br/>   on the mountains of Israel. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_19_10">  <sup>10</sup>“ ‘Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Two Hebrew manuscripts; most Hebrew manuscripts your blood">⚓</a><br/>   planted by the water; <br/>  it was fruitful and full of branches <br/>   because of abundant water. <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_19_11">  <sup>11</sup>Its branches were strong, <br/>   fit for a ruler’s scepter. <br/>  It towered high <br/>   above the thick foliage, <br/>  conspicuous for its height <br/>   and for its many branches. <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_19_12">  <sup>12</sup>But it was uprooted in fury <br/>   and thrown to the ground. <br/>  The east wind made it shrivel, <br/>   it was stripped of its fruit; <br/>  its strong branches withered <br/>   and fire consumed them. <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_19_13">  <sup>13</sup>Now it is planted in the desert, <br/>   in a dry and thirsty land. <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_19_14">  <sup>14</sup>Fire spread from one of its main<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or from under its">⚓</a> branches <br/>   and consumed its fruit. <br/>  No strong branch is left on it <br/>   fit for a ruler’s scepter.’ <br/>“This is a lament and is to be used as a lament.” <br/></span>
