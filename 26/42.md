<div class="title"><h1>42</h1><h3>The Rooms for the Priests </h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_42_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then the man led me northward into the outer court and brought me to the rooms opposite the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall on the north side. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_2"><sup>2</sup>The building whose door faced north was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 175 feet long and 88 feet wide or about 53 meters long and 27 meters wide">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse exe_42_3"><sup>3</sup>Both in the section twenty cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 35 feet or about 11 meters">⚓</a> from the inner court and in the section opposite the pavement of the outer court, gallery faced gallery at the three levels. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_4"><sup>4</sup>In front of the rooms was an inner passageway ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint and Syriac; Hebrew and one cubit">⚓</a> long.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="That is, about 18 feet wide and 175 feet long or about 5.3 meters wide and 53 meters long">⚓</a> Their doors were on the north. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_5"><sup>5</sup>Now the upper rooms were narrower, for the galleries took more space from them than from the rooms on the lower and middle floors of the building. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_6"><sup>6</sup>The rooms on the top floor had no pillars, as the courts had; so they were smaller in floor space than those on the lower and middle floors. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_7"><sup>7</sup>There was an outer wall parallel to the rooms and the outer court; it extended in front of the rooms for fifty cubits. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_8"><sup>8</sup>While the row of rooms on the side next to the outer court was fifty cubits long, the row on the side nearest the sanctuary was a hundred cubits long. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_9"><sup>9</sup>The lower rooms had an entrance on the east side as one enters them from the outer court. <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_42_10"> <sup>10</sup>On the south side<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint; Hebrew Eastward">⚓</a> along the length of the wall of the outer court, adjoining the temple courtyard and opposite the outer wall, were rooms </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_11"><sup>11</sup>with a passageway in front of them. These were like the rooms on the north; they had the same length and width, with similar exits and dimensions. Similar to the doorways on the north </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_12"><sup>12</sup>were the doorways of the rooms on the south. There was a doorway at the beginning of the passageway that was parallel to the corresponding wall extending eastward, by which one enters the rooms. <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_42_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then he said to me, “The north and south rooms facing the temple courtyard are the priests’ rooms, where the priests who approach the Lord will eat the most holy offerings. There they will put the most holy offerings—the grain offerings, the sin offerings<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or purification offerings">⚓</a> and the guilt offerings—for the place is holy. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_14"><sup>14</sup>Once the priests enter the holy precincts, they are not to go into the outer court until they leave behind the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They are to put on other clothes before they go near the places that are for the people.” <br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_42_15"> <sup>15</sup>When he had finished measuring what was inside the temple area, he led me out by the east gate and measured the area all around: </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_16"><sup>16</sup>He measured the east side with the measuring rod; it was five hundred cubits.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="See Septuagint of verse 17; Hebrew rods ; also in verses 18 and 19.">⚓</a><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Five hundred cubits equal about 875 feet or about 265 meters; also in verses 17, 18 and 19.">⚓</a></span>
<span class="verse exe_42_17"><sup>17</sup>He measured the north side; it was five hundred cubits<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Septuagint; Hebrew rods">⚓</a> by the measuring rod. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_18"><sup>18</sup>He measured the south side; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_19"><sup>19</sup>Then he turned to the west side and measured; it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_20"><sup>20</sup>So he measured the area on all four sides. It had a wall around it, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits wide, to separate the holy from the common. <br/></span>
