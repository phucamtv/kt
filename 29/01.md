<span class="verse gio_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>The word of the Lord that came to Joel son of Pethuel. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>An Invasion of Locusts </h3></div>
<span class="verse gio_1_2">  <sup>2</sup>Hear this, you elders; <br/>   listen, all who live in the land. <br/>  Has anything like this ever happened in your days <br/>   or in the days of your ancestors? <br/></span>
<span class="verse gio_1_3">  <sup>3</sup>Tell it to your children, <br/>   and let your children tell it to their children, <br/>   and their children to the next generation. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gio_1_4">  <sup>4</sup>What the locust swarm has left <br/>   the great locusts have eaten; <br/>  what the great locusts have left <br/>   the young locusts have eaten; <br/>  what the young locusts have left <br/>   other locusts<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The precise meaning of the four Hebrew words used here for locusts is uncertain.">⚓</a> have eaten. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gio_1_5">  <sup>5</sup>Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! <br/>   Wail, all you drinkers of wine; <br/>  wail because of the new wine, <br/>   for it has been snatched from your lips. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gio_1_6">  <sup>6</sup>A nation has invaded my land, <br/>   a mighty army without number; <br/>  it has the teeth of a lion, <br/>   the fangs of a lioness. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gio_1_7">  <sup>7</sup>It has laid waste my vines <br/>   and ruined my fig trees. <br/>  It has stripped off their bark <br/>   and thrown it away, <br/>   leaving their branches white. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gio_1_8">  <sup>8</sup>Mourn like a virgin in sackcloth <br/>   grieving for the betrothed of her youth. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gio_1_9">  <sup>9</sup>Grain offerings and drink offerings <br/>   are cut off from the house of the Lord. <br/>  The priests are in mourning, <br/>   those who minister before the Lord. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gio_1_10">  <sup>10</sup>The fields are ruined, <br/>   the ground is dried up; <br/>  the grain is destroyed, <br/>   the new wine is dried up, <br/>   the olive oil fails. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gio_1_11">  <sup>11</sup>Despair, you farmers, <br/>   wail, you vine growers; <br/>  grieve for the wheat and the barley, <br/>   because the harvest of the field is destroyed. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gio_1_12">  <sup>12</sup>The vine is dried up <br/>   and the fig tree is withered; <br/>  the pomegranate, the palm and the apple<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Or possibly apricot">⚓</a> tree— <br/>   all the trees of the field—are dried up. <br/>  Surely the people’s joy <br/>   is withered away. <br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Call to Lamentation </h3></div>
<span class="verse gio_1_13">  <sup>13</sup>Put on sackcloth, you priests, and mourn; <br/>   wail, you who minister before the altar. <br/>  Come, spend the night in sackcloth, <br/>   you who minister before my God; <br/>  for the grain offerings and drink offerings <br/>   are withheld from the house of your God. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gio_1_14">  <sup>14</sup>Declare a holy fast; <br/>   call a sacred assembly. <br/>  Summon the elders <br/>   and all who live in the land <br/>  to the house of the Lord your God, <br/>   and cry out to the Lord. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gio_1_15">  <sup>15</sup>Alas for that day! <br/>   For the day of the Lord is near; <br/>   it will come like destruction from the Almighty.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hebrew Shaddai">⚓</a><br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gio_1_16">  <sup>16</sup>Has not the food been cut off <br/>   before our very eyes— <br/>  joy and gladness <br/>   from the house of our God? <br/></span>
<span class="verse gio_1_17">  <sup>17</sup>The seeds are shriveled <br/>   beneath the clods.<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.">⚓</a><br/>  The storehouses are in ruins, <br/>   the granaries have been broken down, <br/>   for the grain has dried up. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gio_1_18">  <sup>18</sup>How the cattle moan! <br/>   The herds mill about <br/>  because they have no pasture; <br/>   even the flocks of sheep are suffering. <br/><br/></span>
<span class="verse gio_1_19">  <sup>19</sup>To you, Lord, I call, <br/>   for fire has devoured the pastures in the wilderness <br/>   and flames have burned up all the trees of the field. <br/></span>
<span class="verse gio_1_20">  <sup>20</sup>Even the wild animals pant for you; <br/>   the streams of water have dried up <br/>   and fire has devoured the pastures in the wilderness. <br/></span>
